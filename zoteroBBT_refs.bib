  abstract = {Demonstrated here is the use of conducting polymers as active materials in the positive electrodes of rechargeable aluminum-based batteries operating at room temperature. The battery chemistry is based on chloroaluminate ionic liquid electrolytes, which allow reversible stripping and plating of aluminum metal at the negative electrode. Characterization of electrochemically synthesized polypyrrole films revealed doping of the polymers with chloroaluminate anions. Cycling of the conducting polymer electrodes occurred via the electrochemical insertion and removal of these anions. Stable galvanostatic cycling of polypyrrole and polythiophene cells was demonstrated, with electrode capacities at near-theoretical levels (30?100 mAh?g?1) and Coulombic efficiencies approaching 100\%. The energy density of a sealed sandwich-type cell with polythiophene at the positive electrode was estimated to be 44 Wh?kg?1 relative to the total mass of active components. This energy density is competitive with state-of-the-art battery chemistries for grid-scale energy storage.},

However, the development of electrodes and non-aqueous electrolyte solutions for aluminum batteries is still a great challenge. Layered-type molybdite ({$\alpha$}-MoO3) is studied here as a positive electrode for Al metal battery and ionic liquid is used as electrolyte solution. The observed maximum gravimetric capacity is 100 mAh g-1, although only a few discharge-charge cycles were successfully carried out and the capacity falls quickly. According to electrochemical, XRD, NMR, microanalysis and XPS results, aluminum cation is intercalated in the interlayer space (van der Waals gap) between the octahedron layers (MoO6) while the main framework is preserved. Because of the intercalation of aluminum and the reduction of molybdenum, the interlayer spacing of AlxMoO3 is reversibly increased compared to pristine molybdite. The intercalation of aluminum into molybdite is a slow process and rather limited to the region near the surface of the particles.},

  abstract = {MXenes represent a large family of functionalized two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal carbides and carbonitrides. However, most of the understanding on their unique structures and applications stops at the theoretical suggestion and lack of experimental support. Herein, the surface structure and intercalation chemistry of Ti3C2X are clarified at the atomic scale by aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The STEM studies show that the functional groups (e.g., OH\textendash, F\textendash, O\textendash{}) and the intercalated sodium (Na) ions prefer to stay on the top sites of the centro-Ti atoms and the C atoms of the Ti3C2 monolayer, respectively. Double Na-atomic layers are found within the Ti3C2X interlayer upon extensive Na intercalation via two-phase transition and solid-solution reactions. In addition, aluminum (Al)-ion intercalation leads to horizontal sliding of the Ti3C2X monolayer. On the basis of these observations, the previous monolayer surface model of Ti3C2X is modified. DFT calculations using the new modeling help to understand more about their physical and chemical properties. These findings enrich the understanding of the MXenes and shed light on future material design and applications. Moreover, the Ti3C2X exhibits prominent rate performance and long-term cycling stability as an anode material for Na-ion batteries.},

Much research has focused on the judicious selection of graphite cathode materials, leading to the most notable recent advances in the performance of AlCl3-GBs. However, the major obstacle to commercializing this technology is the lack of oxidatively stable, inexpensive current collectors that can operate in chloroaluminate ionic liquids and are composed of earth-abundant elements. This study presents the use of titanium nitride (TiN) as a compelling material for this purpose. Flexible current collectors can be fabricated by coating TiN on stainless steel or flexible polyimide substrates by low-cost, rapid, scalable methods such as magnetron sputtering. When these current collectors are used in AlCl3-GB coin or pouch cells, stable cathodic operation is observed at voltages of up to 2.5 V versus Al3+/Al. Furthermore, these batteries have a high coulombic efficiency of 99.5\%, power density of 4500 W kg-1, and cyclability of at least 500 cycles.},

The solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the anode has been confirmed to be essential for improving cycling performances of rechargeable batteries. Therefore, we immerse the Al metal in ionic liquid electrolyte for some time before it is used as anode to remove the passive film and expose fresh Al to the electrolyte. Then the reactions of exposed Al, acid, oxygen and water in electrolyte are occurred to form an SEI layer in the cycle. Al/electrolyte/V2O5 full batteries with the thin, uniform and stable SEI layer on Al metal anode perform high discharge capacity and coulombic efficiency (CE).

It is revealed that the layered SnS2 nanosheets anchored on 3D reduced graphene oxide network endows the composite not only high electronic conductivity but also fast kinetic diffusion pathway. As a result, the hybrid material exhibits high rate performance (112 mAh g-1 at 1000 mA g-1). The detailed characterization also verifies the intercalation and deintercalation of relatively large chloroaluminate anions into the layered SnS2 during the charge\textendash{}discharge process, which is important for better understanding of the electrochemical process of AIBs.},

  abstract = {Recently, interest in aluminium ion batteries with aluminium anodes, graphite cathodes and ionic liquid electrolytes has increased; however, much remains to be done to increase the cathode capacity and to understand details of the anion-graphite intercalation mechanism. Here, an aluminium ion battery cell made using pristine natural graphite flakes achieves a specific capacity of {$\sim$}110 mAh g -1 with Coulombic efficiency {$\sim$}98\%, at a current density of 99 mA g-1 (0.9 C) with clear discharge voltage plateaus (2.25-2.0 V and 1.9-1.5 V). The cell has a capacity of 60 mAh g-1 at 6 C, over 6,000 cycles with Coulombic efficiency {$\sim$} 99\%. Raman spectroscopy shows two different intercalation processes involving chloroaluminate anions at the two discharging plateaus, while C-Cl bonding on the surface, or edges of natural graphite, is found using X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Finally, theoretical calculations are employed to investigate the intercalation behaviour of choloraluminate anions in the graphite electrode.},

Among them, Al-ion batteries based on aluminum anode and graphite carbon cathode have gained lots of interests as one of the most promising technologies. Here, it is demonstrated that the size of graphitic material in ab plane and c direction plays an important role in anion intercalation chemistry. Sharply decreasing the size of vertical dimension (c direction) strongly facilitates the kinetics and charge transfer of anions (de)intercalation. On the other hand, increasing the size of horizontal dimension (ab plane) contributes to improving the flexibility of graphitic materials, which results in raising the cycling stability. Meanwhile, chloroaluminate anions are reversibly intercalated into the interlayer of graphite materials, leading to the staging behaviors. In the end, an ultrafast Al-ion battery with exceptional long life is achieved based on large-sized few-layer graphene as a cathode and aluminum metal as an anode.},

When detrimental surface-related effects such as irreversible capacity loss due to interphase formation (known as solid-electrolyte interphase, SEI) can be mitigated or altogether avoided, the greatest advantage can be achieved by maximizing the gravimetric and volumetric surface area and by tailoring the porosity to accommodate the relevant ion species. We investigate this concept by employing zeolite-templated carbon (ZTC) as the cathode in an aluminum battery based on a chloroaluminate ionic liquid electrolyte. Its ultrahigh surface area and dense, conductive network of homogeneous channels (12 {\AA} in width) render ZTC suitable for the fast, dense storage of AlCl4\textendash{} ions (6 {\AA} in ionic diameter).

  abstract = {A 3D porous composite consisting of nano-0D MoS2, nano-1D carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and nano-2D graphene is successful prepared using an electrostatic spray deposition (ESD) technique. Depending on the preparation procedure either nanodots of amorphous MoS2 (0.5\textendash{}5 nm) or nanocrystalline few-layered MoS2 (5\textendash{}10 nm) bonded to graphene-carbon nanotubes backbone are obtained. These functionalized carbon nanotubes adhere to a porous graphene-based network. Such composites can be directly \-deposited on the current collectors without any binder or conductive additives to assemble a battery that shows superior rate performance and cycling \-stability. For nanodots, nucleation and diffusion issues usually connected with \-conversion are largely mitigated if not totally nullified. The use of mechanically and diffusionally isolated but electrochemically well connected electroactive nanodots offer an effective solution to render conversion reaction reversible. The use of nano-1D and nano-2D carbon structures offer additional electrical and mechanical advantages that are discussed. Furthermore, this technique, which is easily extendable to other electrode materials, seems to be of a great potential, especially for thin-film batteries, flexible batteries, and future \-paintable batteries.},

  abstract = {Rechargeable aluminum batteries (Al batteries) can potentially be safer, cheaper, and deliver higher energy densities than those of commercial Li-ion batteries (LIBs). However, due to the very high charge density of Al3+ cations and their strong interactions with the host lattice, very few cathode materials are known to be able to reversibly intercalate these ions. Herein, a rechargeable Al battery based on a two-dimensional (2D) vanadium carbide (V2CTx) MXene cathode is reported. The reversible intercalation of Al3+ cations between the MXene layers is suggested to be the mechanism for charge storage. It was found that the electrochemical performance could be significantly improved by converting multilayered V2CTx particles to few-layer sheets. With specific capacities of more than 300 mAh g\textendash{}1 at high discharge rates and relatively high discharge potentials, V2CTx MXene electrodes show one of the best performances among the reported cathode materials for Al batteries. This study can lead to foundations for the development of high-capacity and high energy density rechargeable Al batteries by showcasing the potential of a large family of intercalation-type cathode materials based on MXenes.},

  abstract = {Aluminum-ion batteries, emerging as a promising post-lithium battery solution, have been a subject of increasing research interest. Yet, most existing aluminum-ion research has focused on electrode materials development and synthesis. There has been a lack of fundamental understanding of the electrode processes and thus theoretical guidelines for electrode materials selection and design. In this study, by using density functional theory, we for the first time report a first-principles investigation on the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of aluminum intercalation into two common TiO2 polymorphs, i.e., anatase and rutile. After examining the aluminum intercalation sites, intercalation voltages, storage capacities and aluminum diffusion paths in both cases, we demonstrate that the stable aluminum intercalation site locates at the center of the O6 octahedral for TiO2 rutile and off center for TiO2 anatase. The maximum achievable Al/Ti ratios for rutile and anatase are 0.34375 and 0.36111, respectively. Although rutile is found to have an aluminum storage capacity slightly higher than anatase, the theoretical specific energy of rutile can reach 20.90 Wh kg-1, nearly twice as high as anatase (9.84 Wh kg-1). Moreover, the diffusion coefficient of aluminum ions in rutile is 10-9 cm2 s-1, significantly higher than that in anatase (10-20 cm2 s-1). In this regard, TiO2 rutile appears to be a better candidate than anatase as an electrode material for aluminum-ion batteries.},

  abstract = {A novel, dendrite-free electrorefining of aluminum scrap alloys (A360) was investigated by using a low-temperature AlCl3-1-ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium chloride (EMIC) ionic liquid electrolyte on copper/aluminum cathodes. The bulk electrodeposition of aluminum was carried out at a fixed voltage of 1.5 V, temperatures 323 K to 383 K (50 \textdegree{}C to 110 \textdegree{}C), stirring rate (0 to 120 rpm), concentration (molar ratio AlCl3:EMIC = 1.25 to 2.0), and electrode surface modification (modified/unmodified). The study investigated the effect of electrode surface modification, cathode materials, temperature, stirring rate, electrolyte concentration, and deposition time on the deposit morphology of aluminum, cathode current density, and their role in production of dendrite-free aluminum deposit, which is essential for decreasing the production cost. The deposits were characterized using scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). It was shown that electrode surface modification, cathode overpotential, and stirring rate play an important role in dendrite-free deposit. Modified electrodes and stirring (60 rpm) eliminate dendritic deposition by reducing cathode overpotential below critical overpotential ({$\eta$}crt{$\approx{}-$}0.53V{$\eta$}crt{$\approx{}-$}0.53V \textbackslash{}eta\_\{\textbackslash{}text\{crt\}\} \textbackslash{}approx - 0.53V ) for dendrite formation. Pure aluminum ({$>$}99 pct) was deposited for all experiments with a current efficiency of 84 to 99 pct and energy consumption of 4.51 to 5.32 kWh/kg Al.},

Recently, various graphite and graphene cathodes for Al-ion batteries have been studied in this regard, but their costs are not satisfactory. In this study, a novel cathode for Al-ion batteries is prepared by graphitizing inexpensive soft carbon materials (mesocarbon microspheres and petroleum coke) at 2800 \textdegree{}C. The charge and discharge process is showcased here for graphitized petroleum coke, which has a storage capacity of 77.7 mAh g-1 with two high discharge voltage (\textasciitilde{} 2.25 and 1.80 V), higher than graphitized mesocarbon microspheres (51 mAh g-1). It also has excellent cycle stability and no reduction in specific capacity after 1000 cycles. Affordable cost of the graphitized petroleum coke cathode makes Al-ion battery more promising for large-scale chemical energy storage.},

The stage and atomic structure of the graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) are elucidated, in line with the experimental finding. It is revealed that the intercalants tend to be inserted at relative high densities with a charging potential profile and theoretical specific capacity that agree well with the experiment. Four stable GIC configurations are identified with essentially the same chemical potential for the intercalant, giving rise to charging potential plateaus. Low diffusion energy barriers of the intercalants are found, which underlie the ultrafast (dis)charging rates of the battery.},

  abstract = {Identifying a suitable electrode material with desirable electrochemical properties remains a primary challenge for rechargeable Al-ion batteries. Recently an ultrafast rechargeable Al-ion battery was reported with high charge/discharge rate, (relatively) high discharge voltage and high capacity that uses a graphite-based cathode. Using calculations from first-principles, we have investigated the staging mechanism of AlCl4 intercalation into bulk graphite and evaluated the stability, specific capacity and voltage profile of AlCl4 intercalated compounds. Ab initio molecular dynamics is performed to investigate the thermal stability of AlCl4 intercalated graphite structures. Our voltage profiles show that the first AlCl4 intercalation step could be a more sluggish step than the successive intercalation steps. However, the diffusion of AlCl4 is very fast in the expanded graphite host layers with a diffusion barrier of {$\sim$}0.01 eV, which justifies the ultrafast charging rate of a graphite based Al-ion battery. And such an AlCl4 intercalated battery provides an average voltage of 2.01\textendash{}2.3 V with a maximum specific capacity of 69.62 mA h g-1, which is excellent for anion intercalated batteries. Our density of states and Bader charge analysis shows that the AlCl4 intercalation into the bulk graphite is a charging process. Hence, we believe that our present study will be helpful in understanding the staging mechanism of AlCl4 intercalation into graphite-like layered electrodes for Al-ion batteries, thus encouraging further experimental work.},

We exclude the possibility of Al3+ cation intercalation into graphite as in standard Li-ion batteries. Instead, we show that the AlCl4- anion intercalation mechanism is thermodynamically feasible. By including the ionic liquid electrolyte in the overall redox reaction, we are able to reproduce the high voltage observed in experiment. The active involvement of electrolyte in the reaction suggests that the evaluation of energy density needs to take the electrolyte into consideration. Our proposed structural model is consistent with the new peaks appearing in X-ray diffraction from the intercalation compound. The high rate capability is explained by the ultralow diffusion barriers of the AlCl4 intercalant. With the clarified working mechanism, it becomes clear that the high voltage of the Al-graphite cell is a result of the thermodynamic instability of the AlCl4-intercalated graphite. \textcopyright{} 2017 American Chemical Society.},

Two types of energy-storage mechanisms, that is, electrochemical double-layer capacitance (adsorption/desorption of AlCl4- on the surface) and limited intercalation pseudocapacitance (intercalation/deintercalation of AlCl4- in the graphite layer) at low current density, were observed and characterized. Meanwhile, the specific capacitance and cyclic stability of this supercapacitor were also evaluated by using galvanostatically charging\textendash{}discharging. The result demonstrates that the specific capacitance decreases with increasing current density, which corresponds to the two types of energy-storage mechanisms of this device. The corresponding retention rate of this device after 3500\hspace{0.25em}cycles at current density of 0.4\hspace{0.25em}A\,g-1 was 82.4\,\%, which shows good cyclic stability.},

  abstract = {The concept of exploring the superior benefits of electropositive metals as anodes in rechargeable metal-batteries has resurfaced in recent times in anticipation of the future societal need for high energy density and affordable batteries. A rechargeable battery based on aluminium chemistry is envisioned to be a low cost energy storage platform, considering that aluminium is the most abundant metal in the Earth's crust. The high volumetric capacity of aluminium, which is four and seven times larger than that of lithium and sodium respectively, unarguably has the potential to boost the energy density of aluminium-batteries on a per unit volume basis. Efforts to develop rechargeable aluminium-batteries can be traced to as early as the 1970s, however this area of research has seen a surge in activity since 2010, when the possibility of achieving an ambient temperature aluminium system was convincingly demonstrated. In recent times, rechargeable aluminium-batteries have been rechristened as aluminium-ion batteries. This review aims to comprehensively illustrate the developments regarding rechargeable non-aqueous aluminium-batteries or aluminium-ion batteries. Additionally, the challenges that impede progress in achieving a practical aluminium-ion battery are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Few layer graphene is a promising cathode material for aluminum-ion batteries that use chloroaluminate (AlCl4-) ionic liquids as the electrolyte. A fundamental understanding of interactions between the few layer graphene cathode and the ionic liquid electrolyte is key for realizing the full potential of these systems. Through in situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we show that the cathode is capable of achieving stage-one intercalation within the operating voltage window, leading to improved cell performance. We also show that the presence of structural defects in few layer graphene such as pores induced via plasma exposure or nitrogen dopants can deteriorate the cell performance by either decreasing the electrical connectivity or precluding stage-one intercalation respectively. The cathodes made with highly crystalline few layer graphene display high power and energy densities (\textasciitilde{} 200Whkg-1 at 200Wkg-1 and \textasciitilde{} 160Whkg-1 at 5000Wkg-1), and are stable with no loss in performance up to 1000 cycles while fully charging to 2.4V.},

  abstract = {Exploring suitable electrode materials is a fundamental step toward developing Al batteries with enhanced performance. In this work, we explore using density functional theory calculations the feasibility of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) as a cathode material for Al batteries. Carbon nanotubes with hollow structures and large surface area are able to overcome the difficulty of activating the opening of interlayer spaces as observed in graphite electrode during the first intercalation cycle. Our results show that AlCl4 binds strongly with the SWNT to result in an energetically and thermally stable AlCl4-adsorbed SWNT system. Diffusion calculations show that the SWNT system allows ultrafast diffusion of AlCl4 with a more favorable inner surface diffusion than outer surface diffusion. Our charge-density difference and Bader atomic charge analysis confirm the oxidation of SWNT upon adsorption of AlCl4, which shows a similar behavior to the previously studied graphite cathode. The average open-circuit voltage and AlCl4 storage capacity increases with increasing SWNT diameter and can be as high as 1.96\hspace{0.25em}V and 275\hspace{0.25em}mA\,h\,g-1 in (25,25) SWNT relative to graphite (70\hspace{0.25em}mA\,h\,g-1). All of these properties show that SWNTs are a potential cathode material for high-performance Al batteries and should be explored further.},

  abstract = {The development and commercialization of Li ion batteries during recent decades is one of the great successes of modern electrochemistry. The increasing reliability of Li ion batteries makes them natural candidates as power sources for electric vehicles. However, their current energy density, which can reach an average of 200 Wh kg-1 on the single cell level, limits the possible driving range of electric cars propelled by Li-ion batteries. Thereby, there is a strong driving force to develop power sources technologies beyond Li-ion batteries that will mark breakthroughs in energy density capabilities. Li-sulfur batteries have high theoretical energy density that can revolutionize electrochemical propulsion capability. Consequently, in recent years there has been much work throughout the world related to these systems. The scope of work on this topic justifies frequent publications of review articles that summarize recent extensive work and provide guidelines and direction for focused future work. Here, a comprehensive, systematic work related to Li-sulfur battery systems is described, beginning with the Li anode challenges, carbon-encapsulated sulfur cathodes, and various kinds of relevant electrolyte solutions. Based on the work described and parallel recent studies by other groups, important and comprehensive guidelines for further research and development efforts in this field are provided.},
