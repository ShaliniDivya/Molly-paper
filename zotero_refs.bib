The observed maximum gravimetric capacity is 100 mAh g−1, although only a few discharge-charge cycles were successfully carried out and the capacity falls quickly. According to electrochemical, XRD, NMR, microanalysis and XPS results, aluminum cation is intercalated in the interlayer space (van der Waals gap) between the octahedron layers (MoO6) while the main framework is preserved. Because of the intercalation of aluminum and the reduction of molybdenum, the interlayer spacing of AlxMoO3 is reversibly increased compared to pristine molybdite. The intercalation of aluminum into molybdite is a slow process and rather limited to the region near the surface of the particles.},

In this paper, a composite cathode is reported for Al?S batteries based on S anchored on a carbonized HKUST-1 matrix (S@HKUST-1-C). The S@HKUST-1-C composite maintains a reversible capacity of 600 mAh g?1 at the 75th cycle and a reversible capacity of 460 mAh g?1 at the 500th cycle under a current density of 1 A g?1, with a Coulombic efficiency of around 95\%. X-ray diffraction and Auger spectrum results reveal that the Cu in HKUST-1 forms S?Cu ionic clusters. This serves to facilitate the electrochemical reaction and improve the reversibility of S during charge/discharge. Additionally, Cu increases the electron conductivity at the carbon matrix/S interface to significantly decrease the kinetic barrier for the conversion of sulfur species during battery operation.},

Aluminum-sulfur (Al-S) chemistry is attractive for the development of future-generation electrochemical energy storage technologies. However, to date, only limited reversible Al-S chemistry has been demonstrated. This paper demonstrates a highly reversible room-temperature Al-S battery with a lithium-ion (Li+-ion)-mediated ionic liquid electrolyte. Mechanistic studies with electrochemical and spectroscopic methodologies revealed that the enhancement in reversibility by Li+-ion mediation is attributed to the chemical reactivation of aluminum polysulfides and/or sulfide by Li+ during electrochemical cycling. The results obtained with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations suggest the presence of a Li3AlS3-like product with a mixture of Li2S- and Al2S3-like phases in the discharged sulfur cathode. With Li+-ion mediation, the cycle life of room-temperature Al-S batteries is greatly improved. The cell delivers an initial capacity of ∼1,000 mA hr g−1 and maintains a capacity of up to 600 mA hr g−1 after 50 cycles.},

	abstract = {Abstract Rechargeable aluminum-ion batteries (AIBs) are regarded as promising candidates for post-lithium energy storage systems (ESSs). For addressing the critical issues in the current liquid AIB systems, here a flexible solid-state AIB is established using a gel-polymer electrolyte for achieving robust electrode?electrolyte interfaces. Different from utilization of solid-state systems for alleviating the safety issues and enhancing energy density in lithium-ion batteries, employment of polymeric electrolytes mainly focuses on addressing the essential problems in the liquid AIBs, including unstable internal interfaces induced by mechanical deformation and production of gases as well as unfavorable separators. Particularly, such gel electrolyte enables the solid-state AIBs to present an ultra-fast charge capability within 10 s at current density of 600 mA g?1. Meanwhile, an impressive specific capacity ≈120 mA h g?1 is obtained at current density of 60 mA g?1, approaching the theoretical limit of graphite-based AIBs. In addition to the well-retained electrochemical performance below the ice point, the solid-state AIBs also hold great stability and safety under various critical conditions. The results suggest that such new prototype of solid-state AIBs with robust electrode?electrolyte interfaces promises a novel strategy for fabricating stable and safe flexible ESSs.},

	abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal boron-nitride oxide (h-BNO) is a structural analogue of graphene oxide. Motivated by recent experimental studies of graphene oxide, we have investigated the chemical oxidation of 2D h-BN sheet and the associated electronic properties of h-BNO. Particular emphasis has been placed on the most favorable site(s) for chemisorption of atomic oxygen, and on the migration barrier for an oxygen atom hopping to the top, bridge, or hollow site on the h-BN surface, as well as the most likely pathway for the dissociation of an oxygen molecule on the h-BN surface. We find that when an oxygen atom migrates on the h-BN surface, it is most likely to be over an N atom, but confined by three neighbor B atoms (forming a triangle ring). In general, chemisorption of an oxygen atom will stretch the B–N bond, and under certain conditions may even break the B–N bond. Depending on the initial location of the first chemisorbed O atom, subsequent oxidation tends to form an O domain or O chain on the h-BN sheet. The latter may lead to a synthetic strategy for the unzipping of the h-BN sheet along a zigzag direction. A better understanding of the oxidation of h-BN sheet has important implications for tailoring the properties of the h-BN sheet for applications.

	abstract = {Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an electrical insulator with a large band gap of 5 eV and a good thermal conductor of which melting point reaches about 3000 °C. Due to these properties, much attention was given to the thermal stability rather than the electrical properties of h-BN experimentally and theoretically. In this study, we report calculations that the electronic structure of monolayer h-BN can be influenced by the presence of a vacancy defect which leads to a geometric deformation in the hexagonal lattice structure. The vacancy was varied from mono- to tri-vacancy in a supercell, and different defective structures under the same vacancy density were considered in the case of an odd number of vacancies. Consequently, all cases of vacancy defects resulted in a geometric distortion in monolayer h-BN, and new energy states were created between valence and conduction band with the Fermi level shift. Notably, B atoms around vacancies attracted one another while repulsion happened between N atoms around vacancies, irrespective of vacancy density. The calculation of formation energy revealed that multi-vacancy including more B-vacancies has much lower formation energy than vacancies with more N-vacancies. This work suggests that multi-vacancy created in monolayer h-BN will have more B-vacancies and that the presence of multi-vacancy can make monolayer h-BN electrically conductive by the new energy states and the Fermi level shift.},

	abstract = {Since aluminium is one of the most widely available elements in Earth’s crust, developing rechargeable aluminium batteries offers an ideal opportunity to deliver cells with high energy-to-price ratios. Nevertheless, finding appropriate host electrodes for insertion of aluminium (complex) ions remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for designing active materials for rechargeable aluminium batteries. This strategy entails the use of redox-active triangular phenanthrenequinone-based macrocycles, which form layered superstructures resulting in the reversible insertion and extraction of a cationic aluminium complex. This architecture exhibits an outstanding electrochemical performance with a reversible capacity of 110 mA h g–1 along with a superior cyclability of up to 5,000 cycles. Furthermore, electrodes composed of these macrocycles blended with graphite flakes result in higher specific capacity, electronic conductivity and areal loading. These findings constitute a major advance in the design of rechargeable aluminium batteries and represent a good starting point for addressing affordable large-scale energy storage.},

Such a silica encapsulation has been conventionally implemented via a Stöber or reverse microemulsion process, mostly targeting CdSe-based QDs to date. However, both routes encounter a critical issue of considerable loss in photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY) compared to pristine QDs after silica growth. In this work, we explore the embedment of multishelled InP/ZnSeS/ZnS QDs, whose stability is quite inferior to CdSe counterparts, in a silica matrix by means of a tetramethyl orthosilicate-based, waterless, catalyst-free synthesis. It is revealed that the original QY (80\%) of QDs is nearly completely retained in the course of the present silica embedding reaction. The resulting QD–silica composites are then placed in degradable conditions such UV irradiation, high temperature/high humidity, and operation of an on-chip-packaged light-emitting diode (LED) to attest to the efficacy of silica passivation on QD stability. Particularly, the promising results with regard to device efficiency and stability of the on-chip-packaged QD-LED firmly suggest the effectiveness of the present silica embedding strategy in not only maximally retaining QY of QDs but effectively passivating QDs, paving the way for the realization of a highly efficient, robust QD-LED platform.},

	abstract = {A critical overview of the latest developments in the aluminum battery technologies is reported. The substitution of lithium with alternative metal anodes characterized by lower cost and higher abundance is nowadays one of the most widely explored paths to reduce the cost of electrochemical storage systems and enable long-term sustainability. Aluminum based secondary batteries could be a viable alternative to the present Li-ion technology because of their high volumetric capacity (8040 mAh cm?3 for Al vs 2046 mAh cm?3 for Li). Additionally, the low cost aluminum makes these batteries appealing for large-scale electrical energy storage. Here, we describe the evolution of the various aluminum systems, starting from those based on aqueous electrolytes to, in more details, those based on non-aqueous electrolytes. Particular attention has been dedicated to the latest development of electrolytic media characterized by low reactivity towards other cell components. The attention is then focused on electrode materials enabling the reversible aluminum intercalation-deintercalation process. Finally, we touch on the topic of high-capacity aluminum-sulfur batteries, attempting to forecast their chances to reach the status of practical energy storage systems.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aluminum-ion batteries (AIBs) are regarded as viable alternatives to lithium-ion technology because of their high volumetric capacity, their low cost, and the rich abundance of aluminum. However, several serious drawbacks of aqueous systems (passive film formation, hydrogen evolution, anode corrosion, etc.) hinder the large-scale application of these systems. Thus, nonaqueous AIBs show incomparable advantages for progress in large-scale electrical energy storage. However, nonaqueous aluminum battery systems are still nascent, and various technical and scientific obstacles to designing AIBs with high capacity and long cycling life have not been resolved until now. Moreover, the aluminum cell is a complex device whose energy density is determined by various parameters, most of which are often ignored, resulting in failure to achieve the maximum performance of the cell. The purpose here is to discuss how to further develop reliable nonaqueous AIBs. First, the current status of nonaqueous AIBs is reviewed based on statistical data from the literature. The influence of parameters on energy density is analyzed, and the current situation and existing problems are summarized. Furthermore, possible solutions and concerns regarding the construction of reliable nonaqueous AIBs are comprehensively discussed. Finally, future research directions and prospects in the aluminum battery field are proposed.},

Synthesis with a high proportion of urea yields a product with a majority of 1−4 layers. The surface area of BN increases progressively with the decreasing number of layers, and the high surface area BN exhibits high CO2 adsorption, but negligible H2 adsorption. Few-layer BN has been solubilized by interaction with Lewis bases. We have used first-principles simulations to determine structure, phonon dispersion, and elastic properties of BN with planar honeycomb lattice-based n-layer forms. We find that the mechanical stability of BN with respect to out-of-plane deformation is quite different from that of graphene, as evident in the dispersion of their flexural modes. BN is softer than graphene and exhibits signatures of long-range ionic interactions in its optical phonons. Finally, structures with different stacking sequences of BN have comparable energies, suggesting relative abundance of slip faults, stacking faults, and structural inhomogeneities in multilayer BN.},

However, the lack of a reliable scale-up production method is an inhibiting issue for their practical applications. In this work, we report a facile one-step and high-yield method for the synthesis of few-layered and hierarchically porous BNNSs through simultaneous etching and in situ nitridation of calcium hexaboride (CaB6) by ammonium chloride under moderate conditions. The output of the few-layered BNNSs is as high as 1.4 g with respect to 1.06 g of starting CaB6 crystals. Transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy characterizations confirm the successful synthesis of few-layered BNNSs, most of which are layered with a thickness less than 3 nm (layer number {\textless} 10). The as-prepared BNNSs exhibit a high specific surface area (492–795 m2 g−1) and a high pore volume (0.34–0.50 cm3 g−1). In addition, the as-resulted BNNSs exhibit high and tuneable H2 uptakes from 1.48 to 2.18 wt\% at 77 K and at a relatively low pressure of 1.0 MPa, thus guiding the further search of materials for H2 storage. Our results suggest that the simultaneous etching and in situ nitridation of metallic borides is a facile and effective method for reliable production of few-layered BNNSs with hierarchical porosity for potential applications such as gas storage and functional composites.},

	abstract = {The structure of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is similar to that of graphite before functionalization and exfoliation. For applications in polymer nanocomposites, chemical exfoliation is a more economically attractive route to few-layer h-BN nanosheets. A thermal oxidation process of h-BN powder could achieve large scale exfoliation and hydroxylated functionalization, as described in prior literature. In this report, hydroxylated h-BN (BNO) was prepared by heating h-BN under air, and then covalently incorporated into epoxy resin modified with (3-isocyanatopropyl)triethoxysilane to prepare epoxy resin (EP) nanocomposites by sol–gel process. The structure and morphology of BNO were well characterized. BNO was dispersed in the EP matrix with the form of mainly exfoliated and intercalated structures, and formed strong interfacial interaction with the matrix. Thermogravimetric analysis results revealed that BNO significantly improved thermal stability and thermal oxidative resistance of EP nanocomposites at high temperature. The char yield and the temperature at 50 wt\% mass loss were increased and the maximum mass loss rate was remarkably reduced. Moreover, the addition of 3 wt\% BNO led to extremely high Tg of EP nanocomposite, 42.7 °C higher than that of pure EP, due to improved crosslinking density and confinement effect of BNO sheets on the mobility of polymer networks. Cone calorimeter test results indicated that fire safety properties of EP nanocomposites were also enhanced by the addition of BNO, such as 53.1\% reduction in peak heat release rate and 32.6\% decrease in total heat release, and decreased release of smoke and toxic gases. The mechanism for enhanced fire retardancy is that thermally stable condensed barrier consisting of h-BN sheets and silicon dioxide for heat and mass transfer protects the matrix from further combustion.},

This functionalization induced the exfoliation of the layered structure of hBN into monolayer to few-layer sheets where the sizes of the sheets were dependent on the parent hBN powder used. Exfoliated hBN was shown to be stable in solvents such as ethanol, acetone, deionized water and isopropyl alcohol, and this stability was linked to sulfur functionalization that was induced during the exfoliation process. Further evidence of the functionalization was observed using transmission electron spectroscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). By deconvoluting the high resolution peaks for B 1s, the bonding of boron to oxygen and sulfur was confirmed. The exfoliated hBN nanosheets were crystalline as confirmed from X-ray diffraction and they also exhibited an optically active defect related to sulfur functionalization at 320 nm (3.9 ± 0.1 eV).},

	abstract = {Quantum dots are attractive alternatives to organic fluorophores for the purposes of fluorescent labeling and the detection of biomarkers. They can also be made to specifically target a protein of interest by conjugating biomolecules, such as antibodies. However, the majority of the fluorescent labeling using quantum dots is done using toxic materials such as cadmium or lead due to the well-established synthetic processes for these quantum dots. Here, we demonstrate the use of indium phosphide quantum dots with a zinc sulfide shell for the purposes of labeling and the detection of exosomes derived from the THP-1 cell line (monocyte cell line). Exosomes are nano-sized vesicles that have the potential to be used as biomarkers due to their involvement in complex cell processes. However, the lack of standardized methodology around the detection and analysis of exosomes has made it difficult to detect these membrane-containing vesicles. We targeted a protein that is known to exist on the surface of the exosomes (CD63) using a CD63 antibody. The antibody was conjugated to the quantum dots that were first made water-soluble using a ligand-exchange method. The conjugation was done using carbodiimide coupling, and was confirmed using a range of different methods such as dynamic light scattering, surface plasmon resonance, fluorescent microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The conjugation of the quantum dot antibody to the exosomes was further confirmed using similar methods. This demonstrates the potential for the use of a non-toxic conjugate to target nano-sized biomarkers that could be further used for the detection of different diseases.},

	abstract = {Identifying a suitable electrode material with desirable electrochemical properties remains a primary challenge for rechargeable Al-ion batteries. Recently an ultrafast rechargeable Al-ion battery was reported with high charge/discharge rate, (relatively) high discharge voltage and high capacity that uses a graphite-based cathode. Using calculations from first-principles, we have investigated the staging mechanism of AlCl4 intercalation into bulk graphite and evaluated the stability, specific capacity and voltage profile of AlCl4 intercalated compounds. Ab initio molecular dynamics is performed to investigate the thermal stability of AlCl4 intercalated graphite structures. Our voltage profiles show that the first AlCl4 intercalation step could be a more sluggish step than the successive intercalation steps. However, the diffusion of AlCl4 is very fast in the expanded graphite host layers with a diffusion barrier of ∼0.01 eV, which justifies the ultrafast charging rate of a graphite based Al-ion battery. And such an AlCl4 intercalated battery provides an average voltage of 2.01–2.3 V with a maximum specific capacity of 69.62 mA h g−1, which is excellent for anion intercalated batteries. Our density of states and Bader charge analysis shows that the AlCl4 intercalation into the bulk graphite is a charging process. Hence, we believe that our present study will be helpful in understanding the staging mechanism of AlCl4 intercalation into graphite-like layered electrodes for Al-ion batteries, thus encouraging further experimental work.

	abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) graphene networks are attracting ever-increasing attention in the field of energy storage because their unique architecture at macroscopic scales is beneficial for effective electron and ion transport. Herein, a novel interconnected 3D graphene mesh network (3D GMN) was successfully designed and fabricated by folded Ni meshes assisted chemical vapor deposition method. The structure parameters of 3D GMN can be controlled well by tuning the period of Ni mesh and the electroplating time. With the increase of the density of 3D GMN, the electrical conductivity of 3D GMN and the thermal conductivity of 3D GMN/epoxy composite are greatly improved compared to that of the 3D graphene foam. This 3D GMN enables the high capacity of 57 mA h g−1 in an aluminum ion battery at the ultra-high rate of 40C with capacity retention of 96.5\% after 200 cycles.},

The evolution of metal nitrides/oxynitrides as supercapacitor electrode is strikingly noticeable today besides prevailing carbon or 2D materials, metal oxides/hydroxides and conducting polymers electrode materials. The theoretically estimated specific capacitance of a nitride-based supercapacitor is 1,560 F g-1. These nanostructures exhibit an excellent capacitive behavior with a specific capacitance of 15–951.3 mF cm-2 or 82–990 F g-1, high energy density (16.5-162 Wh Kg-1) and power density (7.3-54,000 W Kg-1). On this account, supercapacitor performance of metal nitrides/oxynitrides is reviewed exclusively. The major focus of the present review is directed towards state-of-art progress in supercapacitor performance of nitrides/oxynitrides, underlying charge-storage mechanism, important outcomes and their limitations. Finally, we conclude with challenges and prospects of metal nitrides/oxynitrides for supercapacitor electrodes.},

The sluggish kinetics of the electrocatalysts toward the ORR requires large amounts of platinum to be used as cathode material, which calls for alternatives to replace or minimize the amount of the noble metals used. This study describes the synthesis and complete characterization of a copper metallopolymer (Cu MP) based on a conducting polymer (CP) and single-site catalytic centers for the electrocatalytic ORR. The copper (II) catalyst, embedded in a redox-active and conducting polymeric environment, was pursued as a potential candidate to replace noble metals in fuel cell applications. Performance studies at a rotating disk electrode (RDE) showed that the metallopolymer exhibited a direct four-electron reduction at potentials between −150 and −350 mV vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and high kinetic current densities of over 22.62 mA/cm2. The kinetic current densities obtained at the Cu MP electrode outperformed most of the reported state-of-the art electrocatalysts toward the ORR. Further analysis of the Cu/CP hybrid revealed the copper being largely reduced to the oxidation state +I.},

Unfortunately, practical implementation has been hampered by various cost and performance issues typical of an immature state of development. One critical factor for the competitiveness of this technology is the installed cost. In this work, we incorporate recent developments in all-vanadium RFB research and present an analysis of the associated cost factors. The major components of a RFB that affect installed cost are identified and used as variables to create a capital cost function. The function is then used to calculate the rate of change of the capital costs with respect to the major components. The capital costs are also calculated for a range of component values and plotted. Key findings include a high sensitivity of system capital cost to purity of vanadium and substantial fractions of the cost associated with perflurorosulfonic acid membranes currently used for proton transport.},

	abstract = {Cyclic voltammetry of three ferrocene derivatives – (ferrocenylmethyl)trimethylammonium (FcTMA+), ferrocenecarboxylic acid (FcCOOH), and ferrocenemethanol (FcCH2OH) – in aqueous solutions shows that the reduced form of the first two redox species weakly adsorbs onto freshly cleaved surfaces of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), with the fractional surface coverage being in excess of 10\% of a monolayer at a bulk concentration level of 0.25 mM for both compounds. FcCH2OH was found to exhibit greater and stronger adsorption (up to a monolayer) for the same bulk concentration. The adsorption of FcTMA+ on freshly cleaved surfaces of high quality (low step edge density) and low quality (high step edge density) HOPG is the same within experimental error, suggesting that the amount of step edges has no influence on the adsorption process. The amount of adsorption of FcTMA+ is the same (within error) for low quality HOPG, irrespective of whether the surface is freshly cleaved or left in air for up to 12 hours, while – with aging – high quality HOPG adsorbs notably more FcTMA+. The formation of an airborne contaminating film is proposed to be responsible for the enhanced entrapment of FcTMA+ on aged high quality HOPG surfaces, while low quality surfaces appear less prone to the accumulation of such films. The impact of the adsorption of ferrocene derivatives on graphite for voltammetric studies is discussed. Adsorption is quantified by developing a theory and methodology to process cyclic voltammetry data from peak current measurements. The accuracy and applicability, as well as limits of the approach, are demonstrated for various adsorption isotherms.},

	abstract = {The synthesis of colloidal indium phosphide quantum dots (InP QDs) has always been plagued by difficulties arising from limited P3- sources. Being effectively restricted to the highly pyrophoric tris(trimethylsilyl) phosphine (TMS3P) creates complications for the average chemist and presents a significant risk for industrially scaled reactions. The adaptation of tris(dialkylamino) phosphines for these syntheses has garnered attention, as these new phosphines are much safer and can generate nanoparticles with competitive photoluminescence properties to those from (TMS)3P routes. Until now, the reaction mechanics of this precursor were elusive due to many experimental optimizations, such as the inclusion of a high concentration of zinc salts, being atypical of previous InP syntheses. Herein, we utilize density functional theory calculations to outline a logical reaction mechanism. The aminophosphine precursor is found to require activation by a zinc halide before undergoing a disproportionation reaction to self-reduce this P(iii) material to a P(-iii) source. We use this understanding to adapt this precursor for a two-pot nanoparticle synthesis in a noncoordinating solvent outside of glovebox conditions. This allowed us to generate spherical InP/ZnS nanoparticles possessing fluorescence quantum yields {\textgreater}55\% and lifetimes as fast as 48 ns, with tunable emission according to varying zinc halide acidity. The development of high quality and efficient InP QDs with this safer aminophosphine in simple Schlenk environments will enable a broader range of researchers to synthesize these nontoxic materials for a variety of high-value applications.},

The composites were treated with and without sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to investigate the wettability of the porous network for drug release and cell viability measurements. CPT release and subsequent cell viability was also investigated. We observed that the cell death rate was not only affected by the addition of our CPT carrier, pSi, but also by increasing the rate of dissolution via treatment with NaOH. This is the first example of loading pSi NPs as a therapeutics nanocarrier into electronspun PCL fibers and this system opens up new possibilities for the delivery of molecular therapeutics.},

They carry specific biomolecular information and are mainly researched for their exquisite properties as a biomarker source and delivery system. We introduce exosomes in the context of other extracellular vesicles, describe their biophysical isolation and characterisation and discuss their biochemical profiling. Motivated by our interest in early-life nutrition and health, and corresponding studies enrolling lactating mothers and their infants, we zoom into exosomes derived from human breast milk. We argue that these should be more extensively studied at proteomic and micronutrient profiling level, because breast milk exosomes provide a more specific window into breast milk quality from an immunological (proteomics) and nutritional (micronutrient) perspective. Such enhanced breast milk exosome profiling would thereby complement and enrich the more classical whole breast milk analysis and is expected to deliver more functional insights than the rather descriptive analysis of human milk, or larger fractions thereof, such as milk fat globule membrane. We substantiate our arguments by a bioinformatic analysis of two published proteomic data sets of human breast milk exosomes.},

structural characterisation and then moves on to the synthesis of metal complexes incorporating these ligands and the coordination polymers they form. Where possible the discussion is presented from a synthetic and structural perspective with highlight given to the pertinent properties of
the coordination polymers formed e.g. thermal behaviour, magnetic, luminescent or small molecule sorption properties. We end the review with some conclusions and highlight some current work with a view to future research.},

	abstract = {The synthesis, structural and thermal characterisation of a number of coordination complexes featuring the N,O-heteroditopic ligand 4-(3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)benzoate, HL are reported. The reaction of H2L with cobalt(ii) and nickel(ii) nitrates at room temperature in basic DMF/H2O solution gave discrete mononuclear coordination complexes with the general formula \{[M(HL)2(H2O)4][middle dot]2DMF\} (M = Co (1), Ni (2)), whereas the reaction with zinc(ii) nitrate gave [Zn(HL)2][infinity], 3, a coordination polymer with distorted diamondoid topology and fourfold interpenetration. Coordination about the tetrahedral Zn(ii) nodes in 3 are furnished by two pyrazolyl nitrogen atoms and two carboxylate oxygen atoms to give a mixed N2O2 donor set. Isotopological coordination polymers of zinc(ii), \{[Zn(HL)2][middle dot]2CH3OH[middle dot]H2O\}[infinity], 4, and cobalt(ii), [Co(HL)2][infinity], 5, are formed when the reactions are carried out under solvothermal conditions in methanol (80 [degree]C) and water (180 [degree]C), respectively. The reaction of H2L with cadmium(ii) nitrate at room temperature in methanol gives \{[Cd(HL)2(MeOH)2][middle dot]1.8MeOH\}[infinity]6, a 2-D (4,4)-connected coordination polymer, whereas with copper(ii) the formation of green crystals that transform into purple crystals is observed. The metastable green phase [Cu3(HL)4([small mu ]2-SO4)(H2O)3][infinity], 7, crystallises with conserved binding domains of the heteroditopic ligand and contains two different metal nodes: a dicopper carboxylate paddle wheel motif, and, a dicopper unit bridged by sulfate ions and coordinated by ligand pyrazolyl nitrogen atoms. The resultant purple phase \{[Cu(HL)2][middle dot]4CH3OH[middle dot]H2O\}[infinity], 8, however, has single copper ion nodes coordinated by mixed N2O2 donor sets with trans-square planar geometry and is threefold interpenetrated. The desolvation of 8 was followed by powder X-ray diffraction and single crystal X-ray diffraction which show desolvation induces the transition to a more closely packed structure while the coordination geometry about the copper ions and the network topology is retained. Powder X-ray diffraction and microanalysis were used to characterise the bulk purity of the coordination materials 1-6 and 8. The thermal characteristics of 1-2, 4-6 and 8 were studied by TG-DTA. This led to the curious observation of small exothermic events in networks 4, 6, and 8 that appear to be linked to their decomposition. In addition, the solid state structures of H2L and that of its protonated salt, H2L[middle dot]HNO3, were also determined and revealed that H2L forms a 2-D hydrogen bonded polymer incorporating helical chains formed through N-H[three dots, centered]O and O-H[three dots, centered]N interactions, and that [H3L]NO3 forms a 1-D hydrogen-bonded polymer.},

Complex 3, [Cu-4(NO3)(4)(mu-CH3COO)(2)(mu-OH)(2)L-2], forms an unusual discrete cyclic tetrameric species containing acetate co-ligands derived through acetonitrile hydrolysis; whereas complex 4, [CuL(C2O4)(NO3)], forms a one-dimensional coordination polymer containing bridging oxalate co-ligands, formed through hydrolysis and oxidation of acetonitrile. Complex 5, [Cu2L(mu-CN)(2)], is a two-dimensional coordination polymer with (6,3) topology where bridging between Cu(I) centres is furnished by cyanide co-ligands, suggesting a ligand decomposition pathway for its origin, and produced with concomitant reduction of the Cu(II) starting reagent. Having initially obtained 3, 4, and 5 serendipitously each were then prepared as pure phases by careful adjustment and control of the reaction conditions (reactant stoichiometry, concentrations, and solvothermal temperature), details of which are discussed.},

Complex 1 is a mixed valence penta-nuclear iron cluster containing the archetypal \{(Fe3O)-O-III\} triangular basic carboxylate cluster at its core, with two Fe(II) ions above and below the core coordinated to three bidentate pyridyl-amide groups. The structure of the octanuclear Co(II) complex, 2, is based upon a central Co-4 square with the remaining four Co(II) centres at the `wing-tips' of the complex. The cluster core is replete with bridging oxide, hydroxide and carboxylate groups. Cluster 3 contains an oxidised derivative of the ligand, L-ox, generated in situ through hydroxylation of an alpha-carbon atom. This hexanuclear cluster has a `barrel-like' core and contains Cu(II) ions in both square planar and square-based pyramidal geometries. Bridging between Cu(II) centres is furnished by alkoxide and carboxylate groups. Magnetic studies on 1-3 reveals dominant antiferro-magnetic interactions for 1 and 2, leading to small non-zero spin ground states, while 3 shows ferro-magnetic exchange between the Cu(II) centres to give an S = 3 spin ground state.},

The structure of 1, [LCoCl(H2O)](2) [CoCl4]center dot 2MeCN, is comprised of two Co(II) ions with octahedral geometry around which two ligand molecules wrap to generate a compact unsaturated double helicate, with coordination about each Co(II) completed by a water molecule and chloride ion. Packing of the complex is such that helicate species align head-to-tail, with the metal bound water molecule and chloride ligand on adjacent helicates hydrogen-bonding to each other in a reciprocal fashion to form a 1D polymer. Complex 2, [LNiCl](2)center dot xH(2)O, possesses a similar molecular structure to that found in 1, however in this instance the coordination about each octahedral Ni(II) ion is comprised from two ligand molecules and two chloride ions to yield a charge neutral unsaturated double helical species. Packing of adjacent helical species in 2 creates large void spaces throughout the crystal lattice within which disordered solvent molecules reside. The structure of 3, [LCu2Cl4], is a single stranded dinuclear helical species whereby one ligand molecule wraps about two highly distorted square planar Cu(II) centres, with two chloride ions completing the coordination sphere to yield a neutral species.

Clearly, in situ mono-decarboxylation of a tetracarboxylic acid ligand gave the tricarboxy-analogue, H3L'. The structure of 1 consists of a 1D coordination polymer that cross-links through hydrogen-bonding between adjacent carboxylic acid and carboxylate groups, as well as through an aqua ligand and lattice water molecule, to form a densely interconnected 3D network. Regioselective mono-decarboxylation of L or H4L at the 6'-carboxylic acid position may also be affected by heating L or H4L in acidic solution under hydrothermal conditions (2:1 H2O/HNO3; 160 degrees C) to yield crystalline 4,4',6'-tricarboxy-2,2'-bipyridinium nitrate hydrate \{[H4L'][NO3]center dot H2O\}, 2, which was also structural characterised. The structure of 2 features an array of hydrogen-bonding interactions that generate a 3D network. More forceful heating of the acidic solution at 180 degrees C led to double decarboxylation and the formation of 4,4'-dicarboxy-2,2'-bipyridine, whereas heating at 200 degrees C led to total decarboxylation and the formation of 2,2'-bipyridine.

The synthesis of 1H-indazole-6-carboxylic acid, H(2)L3, and 1H-indazole-7-carboxylic acid, H(2)L4, is fully described and the structure of H(2)L4 center dot H2O determined. The structures of two discrete mononuclear complexes \{[Cu(L1)(2)(NO3)]center dot NO3 center dot 1.5H(2)O\}, 1, and \{[Cu(L2)(2)(NO3)]center dot NO3\}, 2, have been determined and their molecular compositions corroborated by solution-based methods. Reaction of Cu(II) with H(2)L3 generates a 2D coordination polymer, [Cu-3(HL3)(4)(NO3)(2)(EtOH)(2)]center dot 3(C6H6)center dot 2(H2O), 3, that features the archetypal [Cu-2(OAc)(4)] paddlewheel motif and 1D channels; whereas reaction with H(2)L4 gives a discrete complex [Cu(HL4)(2)]center dot H2O center dot MeOH, 4, in which hydrogen bonding interactions link indazole dimers via a water molecule to yield a 1D network.},

The solid-state crystal structures of 1-3 with SO42- show the encapsulation of a single anion within a cage structure, whereas the crystal structure of 1 with H2PO4- showed that two anions are encapsulated. We further demonstrate that ligand 4, based on the same platform but consisting of two bis-urea moieties and a single ammonium moiety, also recognizes SO42- to form a self-assembled capsule with [4:4] SO42-:4 stoichiometry in which the anions are clustered within a cavity formed by the four ligands.

The mononuclear complexes [Zn(L1)(2)(NO3)]NO3, 1 and [Cu(L2)(2)(NO3)]NO3, 2, display similar metal coordination environments although their intermolecular interactions differ through the presence or absence of a benzimidazole N-H group, which allows intermolecular hydrogen bonding to occur in 1, while complex 2 associates purely through - interactions. The crystal structure of the dinuclear complex \{[Cu-2(L3)(2)(OH2)(2)]4(ClO4)center dot PhMe center dot 2MeCN center dot 2H(2)O\}, 3, reveals a series of cyclic units containing internal cavities, within which reside disordered toluene molecules, and which align to form one-dimensional solvent channels throughout the crystal lattice. The structure of the related complex \{[Cu-2(L4)(2)(NO3)(2)]2(NO3)center dot MeCN\}, 4 consists of dimeric units of similar formulation to that of 3, but it contains no internal cavity, and shows a reversal of the relative metal-nitrogen bond length trend observed for the other complexes, due to the steric strain imposed by the backbone group. The structure of complex \{[Cu-2(L5)(2)(OH2)(2)]4(BF4)center dot 0.5(C9H12)\}, 5 shows that it forms similar cyclic dimers to those observed in 3, which align throughout the crystal lattice to form much larger (ca. 1nm diameter) solvent channels.},

Compound 1 shows a temperature invariant high spin state, whereas the others all show abrupt spin transitions, at or above room temperature, namely, 295 K (X = I) up to 342 K (X = Br), these being some of the highest T-1/2 values obtained, to date, for Fe-II N/O species. We have recently reported subtle symmetry breaking in [Fe-II(qsal-Cl)(2)](2) with two spin transition steps occurring at 308 and 316 K. A photomagnetic study reveals almost full HS conversion of [Fe-II(qsal-I)(2)](4) at low temperature (T(LIESST) = 54 degrees K). The halogen substitution effects on the magnetic properties, as well as the crystal packing of the [Fe-II(qsal-X)(2)] compounds and theoretical calculations, are discussed in depth, giving important knowledge for the design of new spin crossover materials. In comparison to the well known iron(III) analogues, [Fe-III(qsal-X)(2)](+), the two extra p-p and P4AE interactions found in [Fe-II(qsal-X)(2)] compounds, are believed to be accountable for the spin transitions occurring at ambient temperatures.},

	abstract = {TiO2@carbon core/shell nanofibers (TiO2@C NFs) with different thinkness of carbon layers (from 2 to 8 nm) were fabricated by combining the electrospinning technique and hydrothermal method. The results showed that a uniform graphite carbon layer was formed around the electrospun TiO2 nanofiber via C-O-Ti bonds. By adjusting the hydrothermal fabrication parameters, the thickness of carbon layer could be easily controlled. Furthermore, the TiO2@C NFs had remarkable light absorption in the visible region. The photocatalytic studies revealed that the TiO2@C NFs exhibited enhanced photocatalytic efficiency of photodegradation of Rhodamine B (RB) compared with the pure TiO2 nanofibers under visible light irradiation, which might be attributed to high separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes based on the synergistic effect between carbon as a sensitizer and TiO2 with one dimension structure. Notably, the TiO2@C NFs could be easily recycled due to their one-dimensional nanostructural property.},

	abstract = {Heterogeneity is an inherent property of a wealth of real-world nanomaterials and yet rarely in the reporting of new properties is its effect sufficiently addressed. Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) – fluorescent, nanoscale fragments of graphene - are an extreme example of a heterogeneous nanomaterial. Here, top-down approaches – by far the most predominant – produce batches of particles with a distribution of sizes, shapes, extent of oxidation, chemical impurities and more. This makes characterization of these materials using bulk techniques particularly complex and comparisons of properties across different synthetic methods uninformative. In particular, it hinders the understanding of the structural origin of their fluorescence properties. We present a simple synthetic method, which produces graphene quantum dots with very low oxygen content that can be suspended in organic solvents, suggesting a very pristine material. We use this material to illustrate the limitations of interpreting complex data sets generated by heterogeneous materials and we highlight how misleading this “pristine” interpretation is by comparison with graphene oxide quantum dots synthesized using an established protocol. In addition, we report on the solvatochromic properties of these particles, discuss common characterization techniques and their limitations in attributing properties to heterogeneous materials.},

	abstract = {For an outer-sphere heterogeneous electron transfer, Ox + e = Red, between an electrode and a redox couple, the Butler−Volmer formalism predicts that the operative heterogeneous rate constant, kred (cm s−1) for reduction (or kox for oxidation) increases without limit as an exponential function of −α (E − E0) for reduction (or (1 − α)(E − E0) for oxidation), where E is the applied electrode potential, α ({\textasciitilde}1/2) is the transfer coefficient and E0 is the formal potential. The Marcus−Hush formalism, as exposited by Chidsey (Chidsey, C. E. D. Science 1991, 215, 919), predicts that the value of kred or kox limits at sufficiently large values of −(E − E0) or (E − E0). The steady-state currents at an inlaid disk electrode obtained for a redox species in solution were computed using both formalisms with the Oldham−Zoski approximation (Oldham, K. B.; Zoski, C. G. J. Electroanal. Chem. 1988, 256, 11). Significant differences are noted for the two formalisms. When k0r0/D is sufficiently small (k0 is the standard rate constant, r0 is the radius of the disk electrode, and D is the diffusion coefficient of the redox species), the Marcus−Hush formalism effects a limiting current that can be significantly smaller than the mass transport limited current. This is easily explained in terms of the limiting values of kred and kox predicted by the Marcus−Hush formalism. The experimental conditions that must be met to effect significant differences in behavior are discussed; experimental conditions that effect virtually identical behavior are also discussed. As a caveat for experimentalists, applications of the Butler−Volmer formalism to systems that are more properly described using the Marcus−Hush formalism are shown to yield incorrect values of k0 and meaningless values of α, which serves only as a fitting parameter.},

This is achieved by first electrospinning a solution of titanium (IV) butoxide, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), and glacial acetic acid in ethanol to obtain composite PVP/TiO2 nanofibers. These are then calcined at 500 °C to remove the PVP and to obtain pure anatase-phase titania nanofibers. This material is characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). The photoanode is prepared by first creating a blocking layer through the deposition of a TiO2-NPs/terpineol slurry on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass slide using doctor blading techniques. A subsequent thermal treatment is performed at 500 °C. Then, the light-scattering layer is formed by depositing a TiO2-NFs/terpineol slurry on the same slide, using the same technique, and calcinating again at 500 °C. The performance of the photoanode is tested by fabricating a dye-sensitized solar cell and measuring its efficiency through J-V curves under a range of incident light densities, from 0.25-1 Sun.},

The BP86 functional shows a slightly stronger interaction than B3LYP but for qualitative purposes either functional is sufficient. QTAIM analysis shows a bond critical point (bcp) for the interaction, a small negative value for the total energy density [H-(r)] and the H atomic basin decreases in energy, E(H), and atomic volume compared to the free ligand. NBO analysis showed E(2) for Si-H sigma to Zr-dz2 donation at 42.8 kcal mol (1) and a 34\% spatial overlap for the interaction consistent with an inverse hydrogen bond. The Wiberg bond index for the interaction is 0.1735 (0.7205 for the Si-H bond), v((Si-H)) and (1)J((Si-H)) at 2060 cm(-1) and 145.4 Hz compared to 2183 cm(-1) and 172.1 Hz in the free ligand. Using a "synthesis by computation" approach to forming like complexes, similar features were found for [\{Hf(CpSiMe2H)Cl-3\}(2)]. The titanium complex [\{Ti(CpSiMe2H)Cl-3\}(2)] does not contain any Si-H center dot center dot center dot Ti interaction as rotation about the C-Si bond of the ligand occurs to place the Si-H bond hydrogen closer to a terminal chloro ligand across the dimer. An increase in electron density on the metal in the d(2) complex [\{Mo(CpSiMe2H)Cl-3\}(2)] results in a stronger interaction with a distinct QTAIM analysis bcp [rho((r)) 0.0448 a.u.], a small negative value for H-(r) and a much reduced H atomic volume. NBO analysis shows E(2) for Si-H sigma to Mo-dz2 donation at 143.1 kcal mol(-1) and a 29\% spatial overlap. Mo-dz2 to Si-H sigma* donation (back donation) is minimal [E(2) 1.3 kcal mol(-1), similar to 1\% spatial overlap].

QTAIM analysis of the electron density associated with the C-H center dot center dot center dot Ti interaction shows a well defined bond critical point, a bond path between the hydrogen and titanium centres and a negative value for the energy density indicative of covalency. A natural bond orbital (NBO) picture of the interaction shows that the C-H sigma bond electron density donates to a d hybrid orbital on the metal in a linear fashion. Calculated IR and NMR data for the components of the interaction are consistent with experiment. The computed structures for [\{CH(ArO)(3)\}Ti(OPh)] (3),[\{CH(ArO)(3)\}Zr(NEt2)] (4), [\{CH(ArO)(3)\}Hf(NEt2)] (5), show tetrahedral geometries and QTAIM and NBO properties similar to (2). [\{CH(ArO)(3)\}Mo(NEt2)] (6) shows distortion of the tripodal ligand and a reduced C-H center dot center dot center dot M bond angle with properties more consistent with a C-H center dot center dot center dot M side-on donor interaction. In [\{CH(ArO)(3)\}Fe(NEt2)] (7) the C-H center dot center dot center dot M bond angle is linear and involves a donor interaction. An energy minimised structure maintaining the three fold coordination to the tripodal ligand was not obtained for [\{CH(ArO)(3)\}Ni(NEt2)](2-) but changing from a diethyl amide ligand to phenolato gave energy minimised [\{CH(ArO)(3)\}Ni(OPh)](2-) (8). This structure shows a distorted square planar geometry with a substantially bent phenoxo ligand and a near linear C-H center dot center dot center dot M covalent interaction with donor and back bonding properties.

A comprehensive comparison of many possible reaction pathways shows that [(iPr)(2)Cu](-) prefers to bind first oxidatively to the double bond of the allylic substrate at the anti position with respect to the leaving group, and this is followed by dissociation of the leaving group. If the leaving group is not taken into account, the reaction then undergoes an isomerization and a reductive elimination process to give the - or -selective product. If OPiv, SPiv, Cl, or SPO(OiPr)(2) groups are present, the optimal route for the formation of both - and -substituted products changes from the stepwise elimination to the direct process, in which the leaving group plays a stabilizing role for the reactant and destabilizes the transition state. The differences to the energy barrier for the - and -substituted products are 2.75kcalmol(-1) with SPO(OiPr)(2), 2.44kcalmol(-1) with SPiv, 2.33kcalmol(-1) with OPiv, and 1.98kcalmol(-1) with Cl, respectively; these values show that regioselectivity in the allylic alkylation follows a SPO(OiPr)(2){\textgreater}SPiv{\textgreater}OPiv{\textgreater}Cl trend, which is in satisfactory agreement with the experimental findings. This trend mainly originates in the differences between the attractive electrostatic forces and the repelling steric interactions of the SPO(OiPr)(2), SPiv, OPiv, and Cl groups on the Cu group.},

	abstract = {Exciton coupling is investigated in a copper azadipyrrin complex, Cu(L-aza)(2). Exciton coupling in Cu(L-aza)(2) assuming a single pi-pi* state on the L-aza ligand fails to account for the electronic structure of Cu(L-aza)(2), which displays two almost equal intensity transitions at 15 600 cm(-1) and 17 690 cm(-1). TD-UB3LYP/6-31G(d) calculations suggest multiple pi-pi* transitions for the L-aza ligands and simple vector addition of the transition dipoles predicts two nearly orthogonal co-planar excitonic transitions that correctly reproduce the absorption band profile. Empirical modelling of absolute resonance Raman intensities using wavepacket dynamics confirms Cu(L-aza)(2) has two equal intensity orthogonal exciton transitions. The phenyl substituents at the alpha- and gamma-positions of the pyrrole rings play a central role in determining the orientation of the transition dipoles. Consequently the pi-pi* transitions for the L-aza ligands are oriented towards the substituent groups and are not in the plane of the pyrrole rings. Mode displacements in the Franck-Condon (FC) region obtained from the wavepacket model suggest that pyrrole ring and phenyl modes control the exciton FC dynamics. Our results suggest that Cu(L-aza)(2) is an ideal model for theoretical, computational and experimental investigations of molecular excitons in molecular systems.},

Careful analysis and comparison of a wide range of commonly used density functionals shows that the explicit inclusion of dispersion corrections is currently the only reliable way to accurately describe the systems investigated in our study. Moreover, we are able to show that the B97-D and B97X-D functionals are not only able to reproduce ab initio benchmark calculations, but they do so accurately with a moderately sized basis sets and without the problems of numerical integration we encountered with other functionals in this study.

The strength of the interaction between the metal ion and its ligands determines the conditions under which decomposition occurs, most importantly the range of temperatures and pressures at which a given compound is useful as a precursor. We show that a comprehensive analysis of all individual contributions to the ligand metal interactions that establishes the nature of the interaction can be used to select compounds that are tuned to a specific dissociation energy with advantageous properties under experimental conditions. To this end, we apply the Morokuma-Ziegler-Energy Decomposition Analysis (MZ-EDA) to a series of ferrocene analogues using high-level density functional theory (DFT). We find that asymmetrically substituted ferrocene derivatives are unlikely to be useful as precursors because of the large energy required to remove the second cyclopentadienyl-derivative from the central iron atom. However, we are able to establish that symmetrically substituted chloroferrocenes exhibit a wide range of relatively low bond dissociation energies for both dissociation steps and are hence good candidates for the synthesis of highly mono-disperse iron nanoparticles.},

We apply a methodology that has been recently established by us as being of good quality to describe the weak non-bonding interactions of buckyball-buckybowl complexes at reasonable computational cost. In the first step we use five different coordination modes of C-60 on coronene to establish the minimum energy configuration the buckyball will adopt once adsorbed on the graphene flake. We then investigate the PES with respect to dissociation of the intermolecular complex and the rotation of the buckyball with respect to the surface of the graphene flake. Finally, we attempt to extrapolate our results to the Buckminster fullerene on graphene limit by applying the same methodology to larger and larger analogues of circumcoronene. Our results show that while the chosen density functional methods themselves describe the system well, care must be taken to ensure that the accuracy of the numerical integration (i.e. the grid size) is high enough to preserve the smallest energetic features (approximate to 0.1 kcal/mol) of the PES. This is of particular importance when the rotation of the buckyball with respect to a graphene surface is described. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this method a Zn precursor was added to the reaction mixture at the beginning of the synthesis to form an In(Zn)P alloy structure, which promoted the formation of a ZnX shell. Core-shell InP/ZnX QDs exhibit highly intensive emission with a quantum yield over 50\%. The proposed method is primarily important for practical applications. Advantages of this method compared to the widely used SILAR technique are discussed. We further demonstrate that the SILAR approach consisting of consequent addition of Zn and chalcogen precursors to pre-prepared non-doped InP colloidal nanoparticles is not quite suitable for shell growth without the addition of special activator agents or the use of very reactive precursors.},

Its potential application as a cathode material in Li-ion battery is nevertheless curbed by a rather poor capacity of 70 mAh/g. To figure out the origin of this limited insertion, first-principles density functional theory (DFT)+U calculations were performed. The results show that Fe(III) \{OH(BDC)\} is a weak anti-ferromagnetic charge transfer insulator at T = 0 K with iron in the high-spin S=5/2 state. In agreement with the absence of electronic de-localisation along the inorganic chains, lithium insertion leads to the stabilisation of a Fe(II)/Fe(III) mixed-valence state of class I or II in the Robin-Day classification, whatever the Li sites considered in the calculations. Among these Li sites, the most probable site I (OH-Li) and site II (O=CO-Li) are shown to induce incompatible structural changes on the reduced Li(0.5)Fe\{OH(BDC)\} form that could be at the origin of the small capacity measured for this compound.},

Herein, we propose the new idea of encapsulation of a proton-carrier molecule-imidazole in this work-in aluminium porous coordination polymers for the creation of a hybridized proton conductor under anhydrous conditions. Tuning of the host-guest interaction can generate a good proton-conducting path at temperatures above 100, C. The dynamics of the adsorbed imidazole strongly affect the conductivity determined by (2)H solid-state NMR. Isotope measurements of conductivity using imidazole-d(4) showed that the proton-hopping mechanism was dominant for the conducting path. This work suggests that the combination of guest molecules and a variety of microporous frameworks would afford highly mobile proton carriers in solids and gives an idea for designing a new type of proton conductor, particularly for high-temperature and anhydrous conditions.},

	abstract = {In the field of energy storage and Li-ion batteries, searching for new (positive) electrode materials with better electrochemical performances than those of transition-metal oxides is of permanent concern. To that aim, very simple concepts of chemical bonding can be used to find out the origin of the electrode limitations and to guide experimentalists for the design of new promising materials. This local approach was recently applied to hybrid architectures, such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), and allowed some of us to demonstrate the first reversible lithium insertion into the MIL53(Fe) positive electrode. In this paper, we combine first-principles density functional calculations and local chemical bond analyses to fully interpret the redox mechanism of this material. Its reactivity versus elemental lithium is investigated as a function of (i) the lithium composition from xLi/Fe = 0-1, (ii) the lithium distribution over the most probable Li sites, and (iii) the OH/F substitution ratio along the redox chains. The results show that the MIL53(Fe) is a weak antiferromagnet at T = 0 K with iron ions in the high-spin state (Fe(3+), S = 5/2) It reacts with lithium through a two-step insertion/conversion mechanism. The insertion reaction is perfectly reversible and proceeds in two steps: first, a single-phase reaction whose capacity increases linearly with the fluorine content in the starting material, then a two-phase reaction that ends around xLi/Fe = 0.5 due to the stabilization of a localized Fe(2+)/Fe(3+) mixed-valence state along the inorganic chains. Further lithium insertion into Li(0.5)MIL53(Fe) is shown to provoke an irreversible conversion reaction due to a complete loss of the local interactions between the inorganic and organic networks of the MOF architecture. On the basis of this interpretation, several alternatives to improve the capacity of these materials can be proposed by means of appropriate ligand functionalization and/or use of electrochemically active Molecules within the large open space occurring in such porous materials.},

Stationary energy storage systems that can operate for many cycles, at high power, with high round-trip energy efficiency, and at low cost are required.

Here we show that crystalline nanoparticles of copper hexacyanoferrate, which has an ultra-low strain open framework structure, can be operated as a battery electrode in inexpensive aqueous electrolytes. After 40,000 deep discharge cycles at a 17 C rate, 83\% of the original capacity of copper hexacyanoferrate is retained. Even at a very high cycling rate of 83 C, two thirds of its maximum discharge capacity is observed. At modest current densities, round-trip energy efficiencies of 99\% can be achieved. The low-cost, scalable, room-temperature co-precipitation synthesis and excellent electrode performance of copper hexacyanoferrate make it attractive for large-scale energy storage systems.},

We have demonstrated that two open framework materials, copper hexacyanoferrate and nickel hexacyanoferrate, can reversibly intercalate lithium, sodium, potassium, and ammonium ions at high rates. These materials can achieve capacities of up to 60 mAh/g. The porous, nanoparticulate morphology of these materials, synthesized by the use of simple and inexpensive methods, results in remarkable rate capabilities: e.g. copper hexacyanoferrate retains 84\% of its maximum capacity during potassium cycling at a very high (41.7C) rate, while nickel hexacyanoferrate retains 66\% of its maximum capacity while cycling either sodium or potassium at this same rate. These materials show excellent stability during the cycling of sodium and potassium, with minimal capacity loss after 500 cycles. (C) 2011 The Electrochemical Society.

CTAB is used as a structure directing agent, while the other two chemicals are used as precursors for the formation of pore walls. An extraction procedure is employed to remove the template without damaging the as-prepared ordered mesostructure. The obtained mesoporous FeP materials are well characterized by low angle X-ray diffraction (XRD), N-2 adsorption isotherms, and transmission electron microscopy. The mesostructural ordering of the obtained materials strongly depends on the synthetic conditions. The morphology and the crystallinity of the pore walls are investigated by scanning electron microscopy and wide-angle XRD measurements, respectively. It is revealed that the FeP framework is crystallized in the tetragonal crystal phase (I4(1)/amd), according to the Rietveld refinement of the XRD patterns through the MAUD program. The unit cell parameters of the obtained crystals are a = b = 5.1963 (3) angstrom, c = 12.9808 (1) angstrom (alpha = beta = gamma = 90 degrees). Also, the homogeneous distribution of both Fe species and organo-phosphonic acid groups in the mesoporous architectures is confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and elemental mapping. Mesoporous FeP materials with high surface area have great applicability as high performance electrode materials for lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, due to several advantages including a large contact area with the electrolyte, high structural stability, and short transport paths for Li+ ions. Mesoporous FeP electrodes exhibit high reversible specific capacity with very good cycling stability and excellent retention of capacity.},

The reaction results in just a minor lattice contraction, and a broad intervalence charge-transfer band emerges, indicative of charge mobility. Although both metal- and ligand-based oxidations can be accessed, only the former were found to be fully reversible and, importantly, proceed stoichiometrically under both chemical and electrochemical conditions. Electrochemical measurements probing the effects of nanoconfinement on the insertion reaction revealed strong anion size and solvent dependences. Significantly, the anion insertion behavior of Fe-2(dobpdc) enabled its use in the construction of a dual-ion battery prototype incorporating a sodium anode. As a cathode, the material displays a particularly high initial reduction potential and is further stable for at least 50 charge/discharge cycles, exhibiting a maximum specific energy of 316 Wh/kg.},

To this end, we have performed computational studies of intermolecular charge transfer in MOFs consisting of hexa-Zr-IV nodes and tetratopic carboxylate linkers. This includes an examination of the electronic structure of linkers that are derived from tetraphenyl benzene 1, tetraphenyl pyrene 2, and tetraphenyl porphyrin 3 molecules. These results are used to determine charge transfer propensities in MOFs, within the framework of Marcus theory, including an analysis of the key parameters (charge transfer integral t, reorganization energy lambda, and free energy change Delta G(0)) and evaluation of figures of merit for charge transfer based on the chemical structures of the linkers. This qualitative analysis indicates that delocalization of the HOMO/LUMO on terminal substituents increases t and decreases lambda, while weaker binding to counterions decreases Delta G(0), leading to better charge transfer propensity. Subsequently, we study hole transfer in the linker 2 containing MOFs, NU-901 and NU-1000, in detail and describe mechanisms (hopping and superexchange) that may be operative under different electrochemical conditions. Comparisons with experiment are provided where available. On the basis of the redox and catalytic activity of nodes and linkers, we propose three possible schemes for constructing electrochemical devices for catalysis. We believe that the results of this study will lay the foundation for future experimental work on this topic.},

Introducing a one-dimensional coordination compound can keep organic active substances in soluble in the electrolyte during the charging and discharging processes, providing a facile and general new system for further studies. The results show that both the aromatic ligand and the : metal center can participate in lithium storage simultaneously, illustrating,: a new. energy storage mechanism, that has been well characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. In addition, the fact that the one-dimensional chains are linked by weak hydrogen bonds rather than strong pi-pi stacking interactions or covalent bonds is beneficial for the release of capacity entirely without the negative effect of burying the active sites.},

	abstract = {Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have many potential uses for separations, storage, and catalysis, but their use as intercalation hosts for batteries has been scarce. In this article, we examine the mechanism of Li insertion in a MOF to provide guidance to future design efforts in this area. As a model system, we choose UiO-66, a MOF with the formula (Zr6O4(OH)(4))(4) (1,4-benzenedicarboxylate)(6), as an electrode material for lithium-ion batteries; this MOF is of special interest because the zirconium is not redox active. We report both quantum mechanical characterization of the mechanism and experimental studies in which the material is synthesized as nanoparticles to reduce diffusion lengths for lithium ions and increase the contact area with a conductive carbon phase. The calculated changes in the IR spectra of UiO-66 and lithiated UiO-66 are consistent with the experimental FTIR results. We found experimentally that this MOF can maintain a specific discharge capacity of at least 118 mAh/g for 30 lithiation and delithiation cycles at a rate of C/5, exhibiting good cyclability. Density functional electronic structure calculations show that the charge transfer during lithiation is mainly from Li to node oxygens and carboxylate oxygens, that is, it involves anions rather than cations or aromatic rings, and they provide a mechanistic understanding of the potential for increased Li capacity because the theoretical capacity of UiO-66 with Li at the oxygens in the metal oxide nodes and the carboxylate linkers is more than 400 mAh/g. The lithiation process greatly decreases the bandgap of UiO-66, which is expected to increase its electronic conductivity. The electrode material was also characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy, which were consistent in confirming that smaller particle sizes were obtained in lower-temperature syntheses.

	abstract = {In this manuscript, a systematic investigation on the electrochemical performance of as-synthesized metal organic framework (MOF) Zn3(HCOO)6 with diamondoid structure for the Li storage using conversion reaction at low potential is described. Nearly an invariable capacity of 560 mAh g-1 (9.6 moles of Li) was obtained up to 60 cycles at 60 mA g-1 within the voltage range 0.005-3.0 V. The regeneration of the MOF during the cycling and the improved cyclability are evidenced from the electrochemical results along with ex situ PXRD, FTIR and TEM studies. The electrochemical cycling suggests that metal formate frameworks react reversibly with Li through conversion reaction. The matrix involved during the cycling was lithium formate rather than the typical Li2O and this is well supported by the ex situ FTIR results. The thermodynamic feasibility to transform the lithium formate to transition metal formate is more highly favored than from Li2O and this is further confirmed by reacting lithium formate with respective transition metal nitrates. The reversible formation or regeneration of FOR1 MOF plays a vital role in attaining the superior Li storage performance. Ultimately, the observation of improved storage performance and good cycling stability of Co3(HCOO)6 and Zn1.5Co1.5(HCOO)6, and the overall simple and eco-friendly synthesis method demonstrates that robust, thermally stable MOFs are a prospective class of electrode materials for Li ion batteries (LIBs).},

Despite outstanding academic and professional accomplishments, women who experience the impostor phenomenon persist in believing that they are really not bright and have fooled anyone who thinks otherwise. Numerous achievements, which one might expect to provide ample objective evidence of superior intellectual functioning, do not appear to affect the impostor belief.

Thus, other synthetic chemistries adopting alternative P sources to P(TMS)3 have been introduced, however, they could not guarantee the production of satisfactorily fluorescence-efficient, color-pure InP QDs. In this study, the unprecedented controlled synthesis of a series of band-gap-tuned InP QDs is demonstrated through a hot-injection of a far safer and cheaper tris(dimethylamino)phosphine in the presence of a key coordinating solvent of oleylamine that enables successful QD nucleation/growth. Effects of the co-existence of Zn additive, the core growth temperature, and the amount of P source injected on the growth behaviors of InP QD are investigated. After ZnS overcoating by a successive injection of 1-dodecanethiol only, high-fluorescence-quality, green-to-red color emission-tunable core/shell QDs of InP/ZnS are obtained. The fluorescent characteristics of different color-emitting QDs desirably exhibit little fluctuations in quantum yield and emission bandwidth, specifically ranging 51–53 \% and 60–64 nm, respectively. Lastly, the utility of the introduction of a secondary shelling process in rendering the QDs are more bright, photostable is also proved.},

This precursor has considerable potential in biosite modelling studies. A macrocycle L and a related acyclic ligand L[prime or minute] have been prepared, as complexes, from the precursor and 1,3-diaminopropane. The macrocycle was successfully templated by both zinc() and nickel() ions yielding [ZnL(HO)][OSCF][middle dot]HO and the diamagnetic complex [NiL][ClO], respectively. A single-crystal X-ray analysis of showed the zinc ions to have trigonal-bipyramidal environments and the macrocycle to have a stepped conformation. In contrast, the structure determination of revealed square-planar NS co-ordination for Ni and a bowed macrocycle conformation which results in much shorter metal-metal and sulfur-sulfur separations than the stepped conformation adopted in the case of Zn[average Zn [three dots, centered] Zn 3.351(1), S [three dots, centered] S 3.363(3) for Ni [three dots, centered] Ni 3.146(2), S [three dots, centered] S 2.839(5)A for ]. Two one-electron oxidations, the first reversible and the second quasi-reversible, were observed for the dinickel() complex, whereas one irreversible two-electron oxidation was observed for the dizinc() complex. An acetal forms in the presence of ethanol and leads to the isolation of the acyclic trinickel() complex [NiL[prime or minute]Ni][ClO].},

We have synthesized and analysed the photoresponse behavior of plasma-deposited polyaniline films and proceeded to dope the films using light and with various metal ions. Upon illumination, the photocurrent responses of the thin plasma films increased over time, and the response was dependent on the film thickness. On doping the film with metal ions, the photocurrent densities were enhanced from nano- to micro-amperes per square centimeters. Doping seemed, however, to cause the films to become unstable. Despite this setback, which requires further research, the drastic increase in current shows great promise for the development of plasma-deposited polyaniline films for application in the area of organic electronics and photovoltaics.},

	abstract = {In this work, we compare the effect of incorporating selenophene versus thienothiophene spacers into pentacyclic lactam-based conjugated polymers for organic solar cells. The two cyclic lactam-based copolymers were obtained via a new synthetic method for the lactam moiety. Selenophene incorporation results in a broader and red-shifted optical absorption while retaining a deep highest occupied molecular orbital level, whereas thienothienophene incorporation results in a blue-shifted optical absorption. Additionally, grazing-incidence wide angle X-ray scattering data indicates edge- and face-on solid state order for the selenophene-based polymer as compared to the thienothiophene-based polymer, which orders predominantly edge-on with respect to the substrate. In polymer : PC71BM bulk heterojunction solar cells both materials show a similar open-circuit voltage of [similar]0.80-0.84 V, however the selenophene-based polymer displays a higher fill factor of [similar]0.70 vs. [similar]0.65. This is due to the partial face-on backbone orientation of the selenophene-based polymer, leading to a higher hole mobility, as confirmed by single-carrier diode measurements, and a concomitantly higher fill factor. Combined with improved spectral coverage of the selenophene-based polymer, as confirmed by quantum efficiency experiments, it offers a larger short-circuit current density of [similar]12 mA cm-2. Despite the relatively low molecular weight of both materials, a very robust power conversion efficiency [similar]7\% is achieved for the selenophene-based polymer, while the thienothiophene-based polymer demonstrates only a moderate maximum PCE of [similar]5.5\%. Hence, the favorable effects of selenophene incorporation on the photovoltaic performance of pentacyclic lactam-based conjugated polymers are clearly demonstrated.},

Inherently multi-dimensional measurements can directly provide information on both the distributions of individual parameters and the relationships between them, such as in nuclear magnetic resonance and optical spectroscopy. However, when data originates from different measurements and comes in different forms, resolving parameter relationships is a matter of data analysis rather than experiment. We present a method for resolving relationships between parameters that are distributed individually and also correlated. In two case studies, we model the relationships between diameter and luminescence properties of quantum dots and the relationship between molecular weight and diffusion coefficient for polymers. Although it is expected that resolving complicated correlated relationships require inherently multi-dimensional measurements, our method constitutes a useful contribution to the modelling of quantitative relationships between correlated parameters and measurements. We emphasise the general applicability of the method in fields where heterogeneity and complex distributions of parameters are obstacles to scientific insight.},

In contrast to the more extensively studied photoanode systems, current state-of-the-art photocathodes are less efficient and are commonly replaced with rare and expensive materials such as platinum group metals. The significance of photocathodes is in the development of tandem electrodes, enhancing the performance of existing devices. Carbon nanotubes are promising candidates for photocathodes, which, in addition to their p-type conductivity and catalytic properties, possess a suite of unique optical and electrical attributes. This work describes the fabrication of single walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) photocathodes sensitised with indium phosphide/zinc sulfide (InP/ZnS) core-shell nanocrystals (NCs). Under air mass (AM) 1.5 conditions, the sensitisation of SWCNT photocathodes with InP/ZnS NCs increased the photocurrent density by 350\% of the unsensitised output. This significant enhancement of current density demonstrates the potential of InP/ZnS NCs as effective sensitisers to improve the performance of carbon-based photocathode thin films.},

Both α ″-Fe 16 N 2 and α -Fe were single-domain core–shell NPs with an average outer diameter of 50
nm and Al 2 O 3 as the shell. Ferrofluid precursors used for the electrospinning were prepared by
dispersing these NPs in a PVP-toluene-methanol solution. The results show that applying the magnetic
field in the same direction as the electric field resulted in smaller and more uniform fiber
diameters. Nanocomposite fibers containing α ″-Fe 16 N 2 had smaller diameters than those containing
α -Fe NPs. These magnetic-field effects on the fiber formation were explained by referring to the
kinetic energy of the moving jet in the electrospinning process. In addition, magnetic hysteresis
curves showed an enhancement of the magnetic coercivity ( H c ) and remanence ( M r ) by 22.9\% and
22.25\%, respectively. These results imply a promising possibility of constructing bulk magnetic

Physicochemical characterization analyses indicated that the final product was pure cobalt nanofibers enveloped in a 10 nm thick graphite shell.

	abstract = {Magnesium ferrite (MgFe2O4) nanostructures were successfully fabricated by electrospinning method. X-ray diffraction, FT-IR, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy revealed that calcination of the as-spun MgFe2O4/poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) composite nanofibers at 500–800 °C in air for 2 h resulted in well-developed spinel MgFe2O4nanostuctures. The crystal structure and morphology of the nanofibers were influenced by the calcination temperature. Crystallite size of the nanoparticles contained in nanofibers increased from 15 ± 4 to 24 ± 3 nm when calcination temperature was increased from 500 to 800 °C. Room temperature magnetization results showed a ferromagnetic behavior of the calcined MgFe2O4/PVP composite nanofibers, having their specific saturation magnetization (Ms) values of 17.0, 20.7, 25.7, and 31.1 emu/g at 10 Oe for the samples calcined at 500, 600, 700, and 800 °C, respectively. It is found that the increase in the tendency ofMsis consistent with the enhancement of crystallinity, and the values ofMsfor the MgFe2O4samples were observed to increase with increasing crystallite size.},

We realize experimentally a hybrid of mesoscale and nanoscale metal nanowires with high performance, including a sheet resistance of 0.36 Ω sq−1 and transmittance of 92\%. In addition, the mesoscale metal wires are applied to a wide range of transparent conducting electrodes including conducting polymers and oxides with improvement up to several orders of magnitude. The metal mesowires can be synthesized by electrospinning methods and their general applicability opens up opportunities for many transparent conducting electrode applications.},

In this paper, cobalt nanofibers with controllable diameters are prepared via electrospinning. The surface morphology and the magnetic properties of Co nanofibers are investigated by scanning electron microscope and vibrating sample magnetometer. The results show that the morphology and magnetic properties of Co nanofibers can be easily adjusted by controlling the parameters during the fabrication process, such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone ratio in precursor solution, the strength of the electric field, and the heat treatment process. By comparing the morphology and magnetic properties of Co nanofibers prepared under different parameters, an optimized electrospun condition is determined. Due to the quantum size effect, the coercivity of Co nanofibers has been greatly enhanced to 1016 Oe.},

Here, we review recent progress in the synthesis and characterization of well-defined subnanometre clusters, and the understanding and exploitation of their catalytic properties. We examine work on size-selected supported clusters in ultrahigh-vacuum environments and under realistic reaction conditions, and explore the use of computational methods to provide a mechanistic understanding of their catalytic properties. We also highlight the potential of size-selected clusters to provide insights into important catalytic processes and their use in the development of novel catalytic systems.},

	abstract = {Photosynthesis is nature/'s route to convert intermittent solar irradiation into storable energy, while its use for an industrial energy supply is impaired by low efficiency. Artificial photosynthesis provides a promising alternative for efficient robust carbon-neutral renewable energy generation. The approach of direct hydrogen generation by photoelectrochemical water splitting utilizes customized tandem absorber structures to mimic the Z-scheme of natural photosynthesis. Here a combined chemical surface transformation of a tandem structure and catalyst deposition at ambient temperature yields photocurrents approaching the theoretical limit of the absorber and results in a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 14\%. The potentiostatically assisted photoelectrode efficiency is 17\%. Present benchmarks for integrated systems are clearly exceeded. Details of the in situ interface transformation, the electronic improvement and chemical passivation are presented.

Inspired by photosynthesis, solar water electrolysis uses sunlight to produce hydrogen, a clean, sustainable and storable fuel and a promising solution to the energy storage conundrum. Semiconductor silicon has been the basis for several generations of photovoltaic cells but its use in artificial photosynthetic devices is still in its infancy. Recent progress in this area encompasses nanostructured forms of silicon including anodised porous silicon, silicon nanoparticles and silicon nanowires. At the same time, efforts are underway to explore biosilica-derived silicon from marine diatoms for photocatalysis. It is anticipated that by using these nanostructured materials, the solar conversion efficiency as well as cost effectiveness of these devices will be greatly improved. Porous silicon, porous silicon nanoparticles and silicon nanowires have been fabricated based on hydrofluoric acid etching techniques, whereas diatom-derived silicon is a naturally nanostructured form of silica, which can be converted into silicon using a magnesiothermic processes. At present, the performance of synthetic silicon nanostructures is approaching that achieved by conventional solar water splitting technology, producing photocurrent densities of up to 36 mA/cm2. The device performance reported for diatom-derived silicon to date has been far lower (14 µA/cm2) but new electrode fabrication techniques offer significant scope for improvement. This review explores the fabrication, use and potential impact of diverse silicon nanoarchitectures for solar water electrolysis.},

They have recently attracted enormous interest because of their extraordinary and tunable optical, electrical, chemical and structural properties. However, the widespread use of GQDs is hindered by the poor understanding of their photoluminescence (PL) mechanisms. Using density-functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT calculations, we reveal that the PL of a GQD can be sensitively tuned by its size, edge configuration, shape, attached chemical functionalities, heteroatom doping and defects. In addition, it is discovered that the PL of a large GQD consisting of heterogeneously hybridized carbon network is essentially determined by the embedded small sp2 clusters isolated by sp3 carbons. This study not only provides an explanation to the previous experimental observations but also provides insightful guidance to develop methods for the controllable synthesis and engineering of GQDs.},

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy elemental analysis revealed the coatings to be highly efficient and equally selective for copper uptake in natural seawater, reaching a maximum copper loading of 2 wt\% in 48 hours. Similar to observations in artificial seawater we found that zinc was initially accumulated in the coatings, but was exchanged by copper over time. We investigate the spatial distribution of copper in the coatings by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), which revealed that copper was evenly distributed in the coating, with the exception of lower concentrations at the coating-water interface. We use synchrotron X-ray absorption studies and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to show that the copper-ligand interaction was mediated by Schiff's bases (imines).},

For detailed experimental studies about the electromagnetic coupling between plasmonic nanoparticles, precisely-controlled nanoparticle groupings with adjustable inter-particle distance would be required. In the present review article, the possibilities of generating such groupings by using biological and polymeric spacers in between the nanoparticles are described. In particular, streptavidin–biotin and DNA are discussed as biological spacers, and layer-by-layer (LbL) assembled films as polymeric spacers. The concepts are visualized by experimental data, which also point out the pitfalls and current limits of such approaches. Calculation results reveal that while small variations in the diameter of plasmonic cores lead to small changes, small variations in the inter-particle distance due to soft linkers result in significant changes in plasmonic coupling. In the case of protein-based spacers, nonspecific adsorption has to be considered as an obstacle for the formation of controlled groupings.},

	abstract = {Summary
Progress in colloidal nanochemistry has been tremendous in the last decades. Nowadays a large variety of materials, sizes and shapes are accessible via colloid chemical methods. In the recent past research on colloidal nanocrystals has more and more focused on combining more than one functionality in one hybrid system. Fluorescent nanoparticles, magnetic nanoparticles and plasmonic nanoparticles are the three most common nanoparticles when looking at the particle functionality. Hence, in this review we summarize the most recent efforts undertaken in order to combine at least two of these properties in a hybrid system. Possible interactions in such hybrid systems are discussed together with possible synergetic effects giving rise to potential applications.},

	abstract = {Nickel oxide (NiO) is the most universally studied photocathode to date, however, its poor fill factor (FF) makes its efficiency much lower than its counterpart, n-type photoanodes. Its significance in photovoltaics is based on the potential to fabricate tandem photoelectrodes in order to enhance the overall efficiency of the existing devices. Furthermore, limited work on the sensitisation of NiO with semiconducting nanocrystals (NCs) exists. For the first time, we have fabricated NiO photocathodes sensitised with aqueous CuInS2/ZnS NCs. The NCs were chemically bound to the NiO films with the aid of carboxyl and thiol groups. This was achieved without modifying the bulk surface properties of NiO. Binding of the NCs was investigated using TEM, SEM, XPS, XANES, EXAFS modelling and ToF-SIMS. NiO films were assembled into CuInS2/ZnS NC sensitised photocathodes and their photovoltaic properties were compared to those of unsensitised and dye-sensitised NiO solar cells. We demonstrate that non-toxic NCs can be used to sensitise NiO photocathodes to achieve an (almost) all-inorganic system.},

The GQDs also exhibit a broad absorption band spanning the UV region and the entire visible region and a strong deep-red emission. Through in vitro and in vivo studies, we demonstrate that GQDs can be used as PDT agents, simultaneously allowing imaging and providing a highly efficient cancer therapy.

However, little is known regarding the potential cytotoxicity of AuNCs after they enter the cell nucleus. The aim of this study is to investigate whether and how nucleus-targeting AuNCs affect the normal functioning of cells. Highly stable, water-soluble and bright fluorescent Au25NCs (the core of each nanocluster is composed of 25 gold atoms) were synthesized. Specific targeting of Au25NCs to the cell nucleus was achieved by conjugating the TAT peptide to the Au25NCs. Cell viability, cell morphology, cell apoptosis/necrosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and mitochondrial membrane potential examinations were performed on different cell lines exposed to the nucleus-targeting Au25NCs. We found that the nucleus-targeting Au25NCs caused cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. A possible mechanism for the cytotoxicity of the nucleus-targeting Au25NCs was proposed as follows: the nucleus-targeting Au25NCs induce the production of ROS, resulting in the oxidative degradation of mitochondrial components, in turn leading to apoptosis via a mitochondrial damage pathway. This work facilitates a better understanding of the toxicity of AuNCs, especially nucleus-targeting AuNCs.},

folic-acid-conjugated fluorescent Au 25 nanoclusters (Au NCs) is reported. Highly fluorescent Au 25
clusters were synthesized by controlled reduction of Au + ions, stabilized in bovine serum
albumin (BSA), using a green-chemical reducing agent, ascorbic acid (vitamin-C). For
targeted-imaging-based detection of cancer cells, the clusters were conjugated with folic acid (FA)
through amide linkage with the BSA shell. The bioconjugated clusters show excellent stability over a
wide range of pH from 4 to 14 and fluorescence efficiency of {\textasciitilde}5.7\% at pH 7.4 in phosphate buffer
saline (PBS), indicating effective protection of nanoclusters by serum albumin during the
bioconjugation reaction and cell–cluster interaction. The nanoclusters were characterized for their
physico-chemical properties, toxicity and cancer targeting efficacy in vitro . X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) suggests binding energies correlating to metal Au 4f 7/2 {\textasciitilde}83.97 eV and Au 4f 5/2
{\textasciitilde}87.768 eV. Transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy revealed the formation of
individual nanoclusters of size {\textasciitilde}1 nm and protein cluster aggregates of size {\textasciitilde}8 nm.
Photoluminescence studies show bright fluorescence with peak maximum at {\textasciitilde}674 nm with the spectral
profile covering the near-infrared (NIR) region, making it possible to image clusters at the
700–800 nm emission window where the tissue absorption of light is minimum. The cell viability and
reactive oxygen toxicity studies indicate the non-toxic nature of the Au clusters up to relatively
higher concentrations of 500 µg ml −1 . Receptor-targeted cancer detection using Au clusters is
demonstrated on FR +ve oral squamous cell carcinoma (KB) and breast adenocarcinoma cell MCF-7, where
the FA-conjugated Au 25 clusters were found internalized in significantly higher concentrations
compared to the negative control cell lines. This study demonstrates the potential of using
non-toxic fluorescent Au nanoclusters for the targeted imaging of cancer.},

	abstract = {Ultra-small metal clusters with good activity and stability are of great significance for their practical applications in catalysis and materials science. Here we report a photohole-oxidation-assisted approach for anchoring ultra-small Ru clusters ([similar]1.5 nm) with an extremely high density ([similar]1017 m-2) onto TiO2 support. The resulting clusters have good thermal stability and exhibit excellent long-term catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of CO2 to methane (methanation). The anchoring process involves the oxidation of Ru3+ in solution by photogenerated holes on the TiO2 surface to give tiny RuO2 species ({\textless}0.8 nm) immobilized on the surface, followed by a H2 reduction step to produce Ru0 clusters. Aberration-corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (Cs-HRTEM) observations identify the Ru-Ru bond length contraction at the metal surface (relative to the interior of the particle) as well as bond length changes in the defect region at the metal-support interface. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further demonstrate that the ultra-small Ru clusters are well stabilized and tightly anchored onto the TiO2 substrate via Ru-O covalent bonding in the defect region of the metal-support interface. The high-dispersion of ultra-small Ru clusters as well as the strong chemical bonding at the interface account for their surprisingly high catalytic reactivity and excellent thermal/reaction stability. This synthetic method may open up a new way to fabricate thermally stable ultra-small metal clusters for practical industrial applications in catalysis.},

The challenge of preparing highly monodisperse particles for these applications has recently been overcome by using living radical polymerization techniques. In particular, the use of reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT), initiated from silica surfaces, yields well-defined particles from a range of precursor monomers resulting in nanoparticles of tailored sizes that are accessible via the rational selection of polymerization conditions. Furthermore, using RAFT allows post-polymerization modification to afford multifunctional, monodisperse, nanostructures under mild and non-stringent reaction conditions.},

P(MAA-co-CMA) copolymers were fluorescently labelled and imaged in SHEP and HepG2 cells. To understand their cell internalization pathway endocytic inhibition studies were conducted. It was concluded that P(MAA-co-CMA) are taken up by the cells via clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE) (both caveolae mediated and cholesterol dependent endocytosis) mechanisms. The formation and characterization of P(MAA-co-CMA)-doxorubicin (DOX) nanocomplexes was investigated by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), UV-Visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) studies. The toxicity screening between P(MAA-co-CMA)-DOX nanocomplexes (at varying w/w ratios) and free DOX, revealed nanocomplexes to exhibit higher cytotoxicity towards cancer cells in comparison to normal cells. FLIM and confocal microscopy were employed for investigating the time-dependent release of DOX in SHEP cells and the cellular uptake profile of P(MAA-co-CMA)-DOX nanocomplexes in cancer and normal cell lines, respectively. The endocytic pathway of P(MAA-co-CMA)-DOX nanocomplexes were examined in SHEP and HepG2 cells via flow cytometry revealing the complexes to be internalized through both clathrin-dependent (CDE) and CIE mechanisms. The drug delivery profile, reported herein, illuminates the specific endocytic route and therapeutic efficiency of P(MAA-co-CMA)-DOX nanocomplexes strongly suggesting these particles to be promising candidates for in vivo applications.},

	abstract = {An original strategy is presented to synthesize highly pure multiblock copolymers (up to tetrablock) of various monomers tethered to silica particles, by combining RAFT polymerization and click chemistry. Two approaches were compared that follow this strategy. In a first approach, Z-azide-functionalized polymers were prepared via a RAFT process and then tethered to silica particles via a direct click reaction. This approach led to well-defined grafted polymers with polydispersity indices lower than their "as-prepared" precursors, due to lack of dead chains. In a second approach, a one-pot method was employed, using clickable RAFT agents to perform RAFT polymerization and click reaction simultaneously. This route afforded grafted polymers with polydispersity typically less than 1.25, whilst the chain length of grafted polymers was usually shorter than that of free polymers formed in solution, due to shielding effect and heterogeneous reaction condition. A series of well-defined homopolymers, di-, tri- and tetrablock copolymers could be efficiently grafted onto silica particles, and the grafting density was usually ranged between 0.017 and 0.085 chains nm-2, evident from GPC, IR, elemental and thermogravimetric analyses. The one-pot approach seems more promising than the incremental route, since it is a one step reaction that still maintains controllability over surface modification.},

Optimal conditions for the control of VBC polymerization by RAFT are first established, followed by the use of the “grafting from” method to yield polymeric brushes that form a well-defined shell surrounding the silica core.

However, aqueous instability and non-specific biodistribution problems limit the applications of IONPs. Considering this, [small alpha]-phosphonic acid, [small omega]-dithiopyridine functionalized polymers were synthesized via the reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization and used for stabilizing and biofunctionalizing IONPs. A new trithiocarbonate RAFT agent bearing dimethyl phosphonate group was utilized in the synthesis of well-defined telechelic polymers of styrene, oligoethylene glycol acrylate (OEG-A) and N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm). IONPs were grafted with [small alpha]-phosphonic acid, [small omega]-dithiopyridine functionalized poly(OEG-A) through the [small alpha]-chain end of the polymer, as evidenced by FTIR-ATR, XPS and zeta potential measurements. Using TGA results, the grafting density of the polymer chains was calculated between 0.12 and 0.23 chains/nm2 particle depending on the molecular weight of the polymer. DLS measurements indicated that the particles grafted with poly(OEG-A) larger than 10 000 g/mol were stable in water for several days and the mean diameter of the particles was between 40 and 130 nm depending on the molecular weight of the polymer. Moreover, particles stabilized with poly(OEG-A) with a Mn = 62 000 g/mol were stable in phosphate buffer (pH 6.5, 0.1 M) containing varying concentrations of BSA. Polymer-stabilized IONPs were successfully functionalized with two different peptides, i.e. reduced glutathione as a model peptide and NGR motif as a tumor-targeting peptide through the [small omega]-dithiopyridine functionality of the polymer, as measured by XPS and zeta potential analysis. Poly(OEG-A)-stabilized IONPs were also found to be resistant to protein adsorption.},

	abstract = {Multivalent glycopolymers exhibit a strong affinity for specific lectin proteins depending on their specific carbohydrate functionality. In this work, we report a facile one-pot synthesis of diblock PEG-glycopolymers using a combination of Cu(0) mediated living radical polymerization and click chemistry to attach three different carbohydrates, [small alpha]-d-mannose, [small alpha]-d-glucose and [small beta]-d-glucose, to iron oxide nanoparticle (IONP) surfaces. The resultant IONP@P(OEGA)-b-P(sugar) nanoparticles were then extensively characterized using a wide range of analytical techniques, including ATR-FTIR, XPS and TEM. Interestingly, [small alpha]-d-mannose functionalized IONPs, (IONP@P(OEGA)-b-P(N3Man)), exhibited high r2 transverse relaxivity when measured in a 9.4 T MRI. A significant change in T2 relaxation was observed following binding to the lectin concanavalin A (Con A), with a response proportional to the lectin concentration. The results reported herein indicate that the specific binding of lectin to nanoparticle surfaces can be quantitatively detected using MRI, showing significant promise for future diagnostic applications. Additionally we found a significant improvement in cell uptake for IONPs functionalized with [small alpha]-d-mannose, in a lung cancer cell line (A549).},

	abstract = {Overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family has been implicated in cancer because of its participation in signaling pathways regulating cellular proliferation, differentiation, motility, and survival. In this work, we exploited the extracellular binding property of trastuzumab, a clinically therapeutic monoclonal antibody to the second member of the HER family (HER2), to design a diagnostic imaging agent, (111In-DTPA)n-trastuzumab-(IRDye 800CW)m, that is dual labeled with 111In, a γ-emitter, and a near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent dye, IRDye 800CW, to detect HER2 overexpression in breast cancer cells. The stoichiometric ratios “n” and “m” refer to the number of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid dianhydride (DTPA) and IRDye 800CW molecules bound per trastuzumab molecule, respectively. Methods: Fluorescence microscopy and confocal microscopy were used to determine the molecular specificity of (DTPA)n-trastuzumab-(IRDye800)m in vitro in SKBr3 (HER2-positive) and MDA-MB-231 (HER2-negative) breast cancer cells. SKBr3 cells were incubated with (DTPA)n-trastuzumab-(IRDye800)m or IRDye800CW or pretreated with trastuzumab or human IgG followed by (DTPA)n-trastuzumab-(IRDye800)m and examined under a fluorescence microscope. For in vivo characterization, athymic nude mice bearing HER2-overexpressing SKBr3-luc subcutaneous xenografts were injected intravenously with (111In-DTPA)n-trastuzumab-(IRDye800)m and imaged with SPECT and NIR fluorescence imaging at 48 h. Tumor-bearing mice were also injected intravenously with trastuzumab 24 h before administration of (111In-DTPA)n-trastuzumab-(IRDye800)m. Nonspecific uptake in the SKBr3-luc tumors was analyzed by injecting the mice with IRDye 800CW and (111In-DTPA)p-IgG-(IRDye800)q, where “p” and “q” are the stoichiometric ratios of DTPA and IRDye 800CW bound per IgG antibody, respectively. Results: (DTPA)n-trastuzumab-(IRDye800)m showed significantly greater binding to SKBr3 cells than to MDA-MB-231 cells. Confocal imaging revealed that this binding occurred predominantly around the cell membrane. Competitive binding studies with excess trastuzumab before incubation with (DTPA)n-trastuzumab-(IRDye800)m abolished this binding affinity, but pretreatment with nonspecific IgG did not alter binding. In vivo nuclear and optical imaging of SKBr3-luc xenografts injected with (111In-DTPA)n-trastuzumab-(IRDye800)m revealed significantly more uptake in the tumor region than in the contralateral muscle region. The tumor-to-muscle ratio decreased in mice pretreated with trastuzumab and in mice injected with IRDye 800CW and (111In-DTPA)p-IgG-(IRDye800)q. Ex vivo imaging of dissected organs confirmed these results. Finally, coregistration of histologic hematoxylin–eosin stains with autoradiography signals from tumor and muscle tissue slices indicated that (111In-DTPA)n-trastuzumab-(IRDye800)m bound only in tumor tissue and not to muscle. Conclusion: Dual-labeled (111In-DTPA)n-trastuzumab-(IRDye800)m may be an effective diagnostic biomarker capable of tracking HER2 overexpression in breast cancer patients.},

Key features of nanoparticle metabolism, namely intracellular sequestration by microglia and the combined optical and magnetic properties of the probe, allowed delineation of brain tumors both by preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and by intraoperative optical imaging. This prototypical multimodal nanoparticle has unique properties that may allow radiologists and neurosurgeons to see the same probe in the same cells and may offer a new approach for obtaining tumor margins.},

Quantitative biodistributions of the nanoparticles 24 h after i.v. tail-vein injections show that the nanoparticle accumulations in the tumors and other organs are independent of Tf. However, the nanoparticle localizations within a particular organ are influenced by the Tf content. In tumor tissue, the content of targeting ligands significantly influences the number of nanoparticles localized within the cancer cells. In liver tissue, high Tf content leads to small amounts of the nanoparticles residing in hepatocytes, whereas most nanoparticles remain in nonparenchymal cells.

Despite proven success in nanoparticle accumulation at cellular locations and occurrence of downstream therapeutic effects (e.g., target gene inhibition) in a selected few organs such as tumor and liver, reports on effective delivery of engineered nanoparticles to other organs still remain scarce. Here, we show that nanoparticles of {\textasciitilde}75 ± 25-nm diameters target the mesangium of the kidney. These data show the effects of particle diameter on targeting the mesangium of the kidney. Because many diseases originate from this area of the kidney, our findings establish design criteria for constructing nanoparticle-based therapeutics for targeting diseases that involve the mesangium of the kidney.},

	abstract = {Here, we report the development of a multifunctional nanocarrier consisting of paramagnetic graphene quantum dots (GQDs), folate, and doxorubicin (Dox), used as delivery vehicles, a targeting ligand, and a chemotherapeutic drug, respectively. The paramagnetic GQDs, named folate-GdGQDs, were successfully prepared by covalently conjugating diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid gadolinium and folic acid onto the surface of GQDs. The resultant folate-GdGQDs, which showed a longitudinal relaxivity r1 of 11.49 mM-1 s-1, greatly enhanced the brightness of the T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images, indicating their potential for use as positive contrast agents for MR imaging (MRI). The feasibility of utilizing the folate-GdGQDs with strong luminescence emissions for targeted imaging of HeLa cells was also evaluated. An in vitro cell (HeLa and HepG2 cells) viability assay and in vivo evaluation of toxicity to the embryonic development of zebrafish showed that these folate-GdGQDs exhibited negligible cytotoxicity and excellent biocompatibility within the given range of concentrations. More importantly, strong therapeutic activity was achieved by loading Dox onto the surfaces of folate-GdGQDs through [small pi]-[small pi] stacking and hydrophobic interactions, leading to the formation of folate-GdGQD/Dox multifunctional nanocarriers. Approximately 80\% of the loaded Dox was released from the folate-GdGQD/Dox nanocarriers under mild acidic conditions (pH 5.0), whereas only 20\% of Dox was released at pH 7.0 after 48 h. Furthermore, these multifunctional nanocarriers could efficiently induce an inhibitory effect on HeLa cells, as confirmed by an in vitro cytotoxicity assay. The combined flow cytometry analysis and confocal laser scanning microscopic observation showed that these nanocarriers were efficiently taken up by the cancer cells overexpressing folate receptors. Taken together, these results suggested that the multifunctional nanocarriers could be used as promising targeted drug delivery vehicles for the diagnosis and image-guided chemotherapy of various cancers.},

improve the sensitivity of early cancer diagnosis. In this study, highly upconverting fluorescence
and strong relaxivity rare-earth nanoparticles coated with paramagnetic lanthanide complex shells
and polyethylene glycol (PEGylated UCNPs@DTPA-Gd 3+ ) are synthesized as dual-modality imaging
contrast agents (CAs) for upconverting fluorescent and magnetic resonance dual-modality imaging.
PEGylated UCNPs@DTPA-Gd 3+ with sizes in the range of 32–86 nm are colloidally stable. They exhibit
higher longitudinal relaxivity and transverse relaxivity in water ( r 1 and r 2 values are 7.4 and
27.8 s −1 per mM Gd 3+ , respectively) than does commercial Gd–DTPA ( r 1 and r 2 values of 3.7 and
4.6 s −1 per mM Gd 3+ , respectively). They are found to be biocompatible. In vitro cancer cell
imaging shows good imaging contrast of PEGylated UCNPs@DTPA-Gd 3+ . In vivo upconversion fluorescent
imaging and T 1 -weighted MRI show excellent enhancement of both fluorescent and MR signals in the
livers of mice administered PEGylated UCNPs@DTPA-Gd 3+ . All the experimental results indicate that
the synthesized PEGylated UCNPs@DTPA-Gd 3+ present great potential for biomedical upconversion of
fluorescent and magnetic resonance dual-modality imaging applications.},

The contrast in chemistry of these two groups was highlighted by attaching a fluorophore, Rhodamine B isothiocyanate (RITC) onto the amine group and an antibody (EPCAM - epithelial cell adhesion molecule) onto the carboxylic acid groups. The iron oxide core and the RITC tags provide the MRI-fluorescent bi-modal imaging capability. The EPCAM antibody is specific to a protein ubiquitously expressed on the epithelial cell surface. These bifunctionalized nanoparticles target and then undergo facilitated uptake into pancreatic cancer cells (Panc-1) in a time course-monitored controlled study. The integrated optical imaging properties of these magnetic nanoparticles were utilized to monitor the interaction of the nanoparticles with the EPCAM receptors on the cell membrane of the Panc-1 cells. The time-course of the uptake for the targeted and the control particles by the cells was followed allowing the localization within the cell and the impact of particle functionalization to be identified. This system is a candidate for further development as a multi-modular imaging, diagnostic and delivery tool.},

	abstract = {Nanotechnology is providing exciting and new opportunities which are likely to revolutionize future clinical practice. The use of nanoparticles for biomedical applications is particularly exciting due to their huge potential for multi-modal approaches. This includes their use as drug delivery vectors, imaging contrast agents, hyperthermia systems and molecular targeting. Their ability to cross biological barriers, for example the blood brain barrier, makes them attractive for potential treatments in neurological disorders. There is also great hope that nanostructures will serve as platforms in future cancer therapies. Current cancer fighting strategies consist primarily of surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Each of these treatments is bound by a limit, known as the therapeutic window, which, if exceeded, causes undue harm to the patient. In the ongoing quest to improve our therapeutic arsenal, nanoparticles are emerging as exciting structures for a new generation of multi-modal therapeutics. Within this context, carbon nanostructures are amongst the leading contenders as building blocks to deliver multi-function drug delivery platforms. This review examines the various properties of carbon nanostructures that allow such multi-functionality. Recent advances on the development of novel approaches for functionalization, targeting and imaging via carbon nanostructures are discussed.},

The comparison with rhodamine-labeled tubulin revealed that whereas the rhodamine bleached completely within the observed time frame, the nanorods did not show any bleaching, which makes it possible to follow the key events of self-assembly at high time resolution. Preparation and derivatization of nanorods are described. Water-soluble, protein-reactive group-containing particles were covalently coupled to tubulin. The conjugate was purified by one cycle of assembly and disassembly and used to induce the formation of fluorescent microtubules. These results suggest that the use of luminescent nanorods should allow continuous confocal monitoring of dynamic biological processes.},

However, a prerequisite for many applications is the availability of small, monodisperse, and highly luminescent nanocrystals. Here we show, that a microwave-assisted synthesis approach allows for the synthesis of such monodisperse and luminescent upconverting nanocrystals within 5 min in a closed reaction vessel. Even though the same reactants and solvents as with classical conductive heating reactions were used, microwave-assisted synthesis resulted in differently sized and shaped particles and provided superior reaction control. The nucleation and growth mechanism follows a La Mer scheme and can be controlled extremely accurately. It is expected that the fundamental principles of this synthesis approach can be applied to many other types of nanocrystals as well.},

It was shown that the intensitypower dependencies are identical for excitonic and deep-level emissions in a wide temperature range. At low temperatures (80100 K), both emissions were saturated at the laser power used, which generates more than one exciton per nanocrystal. A transition point from the linear to the saturated region was dependent on the temperature, size, and quality of the NCs. A clear inverse dependency between the intensities of excitonic and deep-level emissions was revealed at 80 K over the entire sample area. At room-temperature, the quantum yield dropped significantly and a higher laser power was needed to reach PL saturation. An increase in temperature led to worsening of the reverse dependence between excitonic and deep-level emissions, and at room-temperature, they became uncorrelated. These results can be explained by Auger recombination and also by an increase of nonradiative recombination in the surface states with increasing temperature.},

(ITP), laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) and agarose gel electrophoresis. It was found that the electrophoretic mobility and
colloidal stability of ZnS:Mn2+/ZnS and CdSe/ZnS nanoparticles, which bore short-chain surface ligands, was primarily governed by charges on the nanoparticles,
whereas InP/ZnS nanocrystals were not charged per se. BSA-coated nanoparticles showed lower electrophoretic mobility, which
was attributed to their larger size and smaller overall charge. However, these particles were colloidally stable. This stability
was probably caused by steric stabilisation of the BSA coating.},

With this technique, small amounts of liquid and solid samples can be measured without the need for sample supports or containers, which often limits signal acquisition and can even alter sample properties due to interactions with the support material. We demonstrate that, because of the small sample volume, fluorescence measurements at high concentrations of an organic dye are possible without the limitation of inner-filter effects, which hamper such experiments in conventional, cuvette-based measurements. Furthermore, we show that acoustic levitation of liquid samples provides an experimentally simple way to study distance-dependent fluorescence modulations in semiconductor nanocrystals. The evaporation of the solvent during levitation leads to a continuous increase of solute concentration and can easily be monitored by laser-induced fluorescence.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Luminescence color multiplexing is one of the most intriguing benefits, which might occur by using semiconductor Quantum Dots (QDs) as labels for biomolecules. It was found, that the luminescence of QDs can be quenched, and replaced by a luminescence peak at approximately 460 nm on hybridization with certain regions of Arabidopsis thaliana tissue. This effect is site selective, and it is unclear whether it occurs due to an energy transfer process, or due to quenching and scattering of the excitation light. The article describes methods for phase-transfer of differently coloured, hydrophobically ligated QDs, coupling of DNA strands to the QD's surface, and hybridization of the labelled DNA to different cell types of Arabidopsis thaliana. The reason for the luminescence blue-shift was studied systematically, and narrowed down to the above mentioned causes.},

Both InP and InP/ZnS NCs were prepared in one-step, in a one-pot reaction within 20 min using an InCl complex as a precursor and zinc carboxylate as an initiator and stabilizer. The quantum yields of the InP and InP/ZnS NCs were 30\% and 60\%, respectively. This new synthetic method allows fast and reproducible preparation of InP and InP/ZnS NCs with a quality comparable to that of the frequently used CdSe-based ones. It is anticipated that these particles can be used to replace CdSe for many applications.},

This is most likely related to their multiexponential decay behavior as for multiplex chromophores, typically monoexponential decay kinetics are requested. The fluorescence decay kinetics of various mixtures of a long-lived, multiexponentially decaying CdSe QD and a short-lived organic dye were analyzed, and a model was developed for the quantification of these labels from the measured complex decay kinetics as a first proof-of-concept for the huge potential of these labels for lifetime multiplexing. In a second step, we evaluated the potential of mixtures of two types of QDs, varying in constituent material to realize distinguishable, yet multiexponential decay kinetics and similar absorption and emission spectra. Strategies for lifetime multiplexing with nanocrystalline labels were derived on the basis of these measurements.},

	abstract = {Abstract  Although colloidal nanoparticles show an electrophoretic heterogeneity under the conditions of capillary electrophoresis,
which can be either due to the particle-size distribution and/or the particle shape distribution and/or the zeta-potential
distribution, they can form correct isotachophoretic zones with sharp-moving boundaries. Therefore, the technique of isotachophoresis
permits to generate plugs in which the co-ions and counter ions of the original colloidal solution are removed and replaced
by the buffering counter ions of the leading electrolyte. It is shown that analytical isotachophoresis can be used to measure
directly, without calibration, the molar (particle) concentration of dispersed ionic colloids provided that the transference
number and the mean effective charge number of the particles (within the isotachophoretic zone) can be determined with adequate
accuracy. The method can also be used to measure directly the effective charge number of biomacromolecules or colloidal particles,
if solutions with known molar (particle) concentration can be prepared. The validity of the approach was confirmed for a model
solution containing a known molar concentration of bovine serum albumin.

By the use of the atomic force microscope, we couple single nanocrystals with gold spheres (30 and 60 nm in diameter) to obtain enhanced upconversion emission. An overall enhancement factor of 3.8 is reached. A comparison of time-resolved measurements on the bare nanocrystal and the coupled nanocrystal−gold sphere systems unveil that faster excitation as well as faster emission occurs in the nanocrystals.},

The morphology of the resulting nanocrystals can be controlled by reactant concentration and composition. Low reactant concentrations result always in monodisperse, spherical nanocrystals. At higher concentrations, nanocrystals grow into 'flowers' when the crystallographic lattice is cubic, into wires at a sodium : lithium ratio of 1 : 4 and into rhombic shape for pure LiYF4:Yb, Er nanocrystals.},

	abstract = {Molecular or personalised medicine is the future of patient management and healthcare, and molecular imaging plays a key role towards this goal. However, amongst molecular imaging techniques, no single modality is perfect and sufficient to gain all the necessary information. For instance, optical fluorescence imaging is difficult to quantify-especially in tissue more than a few millimetres in depth within a subject; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has superb resolution but low sensitivity and positron emission tomography (PET) has very high sensitivity but poor resolution. The combination of multiple molecular imaging techniques can therefore offer synergistic advantages over any modality alone. However, the problem cannot be solved by simply adding two different classes of imaging probes together, unless they happen to have identical pharmacodynamic properties. Therefore, multi-modal contrast agents or imaging probes have been developed to solve this problem. Despite the great wealth of information that such probes can provide, their development is far from trivial and represents an important challenge to synthetic chemists. In this feature article, we provide an overview of recent findings in the synthesis, evaluation and application of dual-modality molecular imaging probes.},

	abstract = {Electroosmotic pumping in the microchannels fabricated in polycarbonate (PC), polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) and SU-8 polymer substrates was investigated and species transportation was modeled, in an attempt to show the suitability of low cost polymer materials for the development of disposable microfluidic devices. Microchannels and the fluid reservoirs were fabricated using excimer laser ablation and hot embossing techniques. Typical dimensions of the microchannels were 60μm (width) x 50μm (depth) x 45mm (length). Species transportation in the microchannels under electroosmosis was modeled by finite element method (FEM) with the help of NetFlow module of the CoventorWareTM computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package. In particular, electroosmosis and electrophoresis in a crossed microfluidic channel was modeled to calculate the percentage species mass transportation when the concentration shape of the Gaussian input species plug and the location of the injection point are varied. Change in the concentration shape of the initial species plug while it is electroosmotically transported along the crossed fluidic channel was visualized. Results indicated that Excimer laser ablated PC and PET devices have electroosmotic mobility in the range 2 to 5 x10-4 cm2/V.s, zeta potential 30 to 70 mV and flow rates of the order of 1 to 3 nL/s under an electric field of 200 V/cm. With the electroosmotic mobility value of PC the simulation results show that a crossed fluidic channel is electroosmotically pumping about 91\% of the species mass injected along one of its straight channels.},

Temperature-calibrated Raman spectra of ZnO phonons show that intensity-dependent plasmonic excitation can controllably heat Au-ZnO from 30 to [similar]600 [degree]C and simultaneously tune the CH4 : CO product ratio. The laser induced heating and resulting CH4 : CO product distribution agrees well with predictions from thermodynamic models and temperature-programmed reaction experiments indicating that the reaction is a thermally driven process resulting from the plasmonic heating of the Au-ZnO. The apparent quantum yield for CO2 conversion under continuous wave (cw) 532 nm laser illumination is 0.030\%. The Au-ZnO catalysts are robust and remain active after repeated laser exposure and cycling. The light intensity required to initiate CO2 reduction is low ([similar]2.5 [times] 105 W m-2) and achievable with solar concentrators. Our results illustrate the viability of plasmonic heating approaches for CO2 utilization and other practical thermal catalytic applications.},

Recent works have explored the tunable properties of CIS QDs by means of cation exchange with ZnS. Despite this, their tunable properties have been limited to use in organic solvents. This may be due to the cation exchange not being completely understood. For the first time, we present a controllable cation exchange for water soluble, tunable CIS QDs. We also show the partial exchange of indium for zinc, which is shown to provide these QDs with unique optical properties.},

This analysis predicts a high sensitivity for detecting particle size differences for sizes in the range of about 0.4λ ≤ d ≤ 2λ, where λ is the photoelectron attenuation length, i.e., particle sizes in the range of about 10–50 Å. A major advantage of this approach over earlier methods involving the dispersed phase to support phase intensity ratio is a reduced dependence on surface roughness and physical properties of the catalyst. Example applications suggest that many opportunities exist for applying this analysis in studies of multicomponent practical catalysts.},

Clinicians currently use planar scintigraphy and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with 99mTc-radiocolloid to guide biopsy and resection of LNs. However, emerging multimodality approaches such as positron emission tomography combined with magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) detect sites of disease with higher sensitivity and accuracy. Here we present a multimodal nanoparticle, 89Zr-ferumoxytol, for the enhanced detection of LNs with PET/MRI. For genuine translational potential, we leverage a clinical iron oxide formulation, altered with minimal modification for radiolabelling. Axillary drainage in naive mice and from healthy and tumour-bearing prostates was investigated. We demonstrate that 89Zr-ferumoxytol can be used for high-resolution tomographic studies of lymphatic drainage in preclinical disease models. This nanoparticle platform has significant translational potential to improve preoperative planning for nodal resection and tumour staging.},

The labeling yield was 97.3 ± 0.05\% after 15 min and the 68Ga-SPIONs were stable in human serum. PET, MR and Cherenkov luminescence imaging clearly visualized the SLN. Biodistribution confirmed a high uptake of the 68Ga-SPIONs within the SLN. We conclude that generator produced 68Ga can be labeled to SPIONs. Subcutaneously injected 68Ga-SPIONs can enhance the identification of the SLNs by combining sensitive PET and high resolution MR imaging. Clinically, hybrid PET/MR cameras are already in use and 68Ga-SPIONs have a great potential as a single-dose, tri-modality agent for diagnostic imaging and potential Cherenkov luminescent guided resection of SLN.},

	abstract = {The gas sensing properties of polyhedral [small alpha]-Fe2O3 particles were investigated. The polyhedral [small alpha]-Fe2O3 particles were synthesized via a modified polyol method with the addition of an extra amount of NaBH4 in ethylene glycol, and fabricated to a thick gas sensing film after calcination at 500 [degree]C and 900 [degree]C. The polyhedral [small alpha]-Fe2O3 particles exhibited a p-type nature, which is a new result opposite to other results of recent reports of semiconductor gas sensors using [small alpha]-Fe2O3. In particular, we suggest that the difference between structure and morphology of [small alpha]-Fe2O3 particles can lead to p-type and n-type characterization. In addition, we suggested that Na ions from NaBH4 were incorporated into [small alpha]-Fe2O3 oxide. They are the cause of the generation of holes in [small alpha]-Fe2O3 oxide that led to the p-type nature of [small alpha]-Fe2O3 oxide. The measurement of the sensor response to hydrogen, carbon monoxide, toluene, propane and ethanol revealed that the sensor device synthesized using polyhedral [small alpha]-Fe2O3 particles is sensitive to hydrocarbons and ethanol. Importantly, the sensor device using polyhedral [small alpha]-Fe2O3 particles calcined at 900 [degree]C was strongly sensitive to ethanol due to the porous structure of the [small alpha]-Fe2O3 particles.},

Effects of post-deposition treatments were investigated by comparison of untreated samples with analogues that have been heat treated at 200 [degree]C in O2, or in O2 followed by H2 atmosphere. XPS data shows that the phosphine ligands are oxidised upon heat treatment in O2. From the position of the Au 4f7/2 peak it can be concluded that the clusters partially agglomerate immediately upon deposition. Heating in oxygen, and subsequently in hydrogen, leads to further agglomeration of the gold clusters. It is found that the pre-treatment plays a crucial role in the removal of ligands and agglomeration of the clusters.},

Far-IR spectra of the Au6(Ph2P(CH2)3PPh2)4(NO3)2, Au8(PPh3)8(NO3)2, Au9(PPh3)8(NO3)3, and Pd(PPh3)Au6(PPh3)6(NO3)2 clusters reveal a complex series of peaks between 80 and 475 cm-1, for which all significant peaks can be unambiguously assigned by comparison with Density Functional Theory (DFT) geometry optimisations and frequency calculation. Strong absorptions in all spectra near 420 cm-1 are assigned to the P-Ph3 stretching vibrations. Distinct peaks within the spectrum of each specific cluster are assigned to the cluster core vibrations: 80.4 and 84.1 cm-1 (Au6) 165.1 and 166.4 cm-1 (Au8), 170.1 and 185.2 cm-1 (Au9), and 158.9, 195.2, and 206.7 cm-1 (Au6Pd).

The loaded Ru nanoparticles exhibited a narrow particle-size distribution with a mean diameter of ca. 2.5 nm. Methanation of CO2 on the Ru/TiO2(B) catalyst produced a 100\% yield at ca. 160 [degree]C, which is more than 200 [degree]C below that required for Ru/TiO2 prepared by a conventional "wet" impregnation method. In addition, the methanation reaction over Ru/TiO2(B) proceeded at temperatures as low as room temperature with a reaction rate of 0.04 [small micro]mol min-1 g-1.},

Here, we report mesoscopic solar cells that incorporate a Co(II/III)tris(bipyridyl)–based redox electrolyte in conjunction with a custom synthesized donor-π-bridge-acceptor zinc porphyrin dye as sensitizer (designated YD2-o-C8). The specific molecular design of YD2-o-C8 greatly retards the rate of interfacial back electron transfer from the conduction band of the nanocrystalline titanium dioxide film to the oxidized cobalt mediator, which enables attainment of strikingly high photovoltages approaching 1 volt. Because the YD2-o-C8 porphyrin harvests sunlight across the visible spectrum, large photocurrents are generated. Cosensitization of YD2-o-C8 with another organic dye further enhances the performance of the device, leading to a measured power conversion efficiency of 12.3\% under simulated air mass 1.5 global sunlight.},

For all these structures, the underlying Nb5 cluster has either a "prolate" or "oblate" trigonal bipyramid geometry.

The gold clusters were washed with toluene at 100 [degree]C or calcined at 200 [degree]C to remove the organic ligand. From the position of the Au 4f7/2 peak it is concluded that cluster size is not altered through the deposition. From the analysis of the phosphorous spectra, it can be concluded that the applied heat treatment removes the organic ligands. Washing and calcination leads to partial oxidation and partial agglomeration of the clusters. Oxidation of the clusters is most likely due to the interaction of the cluster core with the oxygen of the titania surface after removal of ligands. The position of the Au 4f7/2 peak indicates that the size of the agglomerated clusters is still smaller than that of Au101.},

This discovery inspired extensive research addressing the origin of the unique properties of supported Au nanoparticles, the design and synthesis of potentially technical Au catalysts, and the extension of Au catalysis to other reactions. This tutorial review summarises the current understanding of the origin of the unique properties of titania-supported Au catalysts for carbon monoxide oxidation. The key issues of catalysis by nanostructured Au, effects of oxide support and active site/structure, especially those provided from model studies are discussed in detail. The successful synthesis of a highly catalytically active gold bilayer may lead to the design and synthesis of practically active Au nanofilm catalysts.},

In this article, electronic and chemical properties of various model catalysts consisting of Au are reported. Au supported by oxide surfaces becomes inert towards chemisorption and oxidation as the particle size became smaller than a critical size (2-3 nm). The inertness of these small Au nanoparticles is due to the electron-deficient nature of smaller Au nanoparticles, which is a result of metal-substrate charge transfer. Properties of Au clusters smaller than [similar]20 atoms were shown to be non-scalable, i.e., every atom can drastically change the chemical properties of the clusters. Moreover, clusters with the same size can show dissimilar properties on various substrates. These recent endeavours show that the activity of a catalyst can be tuned by varying the substrate or by varying the cluster size on an atom-by-atom basis.},

Charging of the supported clusters plays a key role in promoting their chemical activity. Infrared measurements of the stretch vibration of CO adsorbed on mass-selected gold octamers soft-landed on MgO(001) with coadsorbed O2 show a red shift on an F-center–rich surface with respect to the perfect surface. The experiments agree with quantum ab initio calculations that predict that a red shift of the C–O vibration should arise via electron back-donation to the CO antibonding orbital.},

However, the tiny size of the metal clusters brings the difficulty of their synthesis compared to the easier preparation of large nanoparticles. Up to now various synthetic techniques and routes have been successfully applied to the preparation of sub-nanometre clusters. Among the metals, gold clusters, especially the alkanethiolate monolayer protected clusters (MPCs), have been extensively investigated during the past decades. In recent years, silver and copper nanoclusters have also attracted enormous interest mainly due to their excellent photoluminescent properties. Meanwhile, more structural characteristics, particular optical, catalytic, electronic and magnetic properties and the related technical applications of the metal nanoclusters have been discovered in recent years. In this critical review, recent advances in sub-nanometre sized metal clusters (Au, Ag, Cu, etc.) including the synthetic techniques, structural characterizations, novel physical, chemical and optical properties and their potential applications are discussed in detail. We finally give a brief outlook on the future development of metal nanoclusters from the viewpoint of controlled synthesis and their potential applications.},

	abstract = {BiVO4 and many other semiconductor materials are ideal visible light responsive semiconductors, but are insufficient for overall water splitting. Upon loading water oxidation cocatalyst, for example Co-borate (denoted as CoBi) used here, onto BiVO4 photoanode, it is found that not only the onset potential is negatively shifted but also the photocurrent and the stability are significantly improved. And more importantly, PEC overall water splitting to H2 and O2 is realized using CoBi/BiVO4 as photoanode with a rather low applied bias (less than 0.3 V vs. counter electrode) in a two-electrode scheme, while at least 0.6 V is needed for bare BiVO4. This work demonstrates the practical possibility of achieving overall water splitting using the PEC strategy under a bias as low as the theoretical minimum, which is the difference between the flat band and proton reduction potential for a photoanode thermodynamically insufficient for water reduction. As long as the water oxidation overpotential is overcome with an efficient cocatalyst, the applied bias of the whole system is only used for that thermodynamically required for the proton reduction.},

Degradation of the CdS occurs when the coated particles are incorporated within silica gels with an open structure, which suggests that the shells somehow crack due to tension in the gel structure.

Quantum dots can be stabilized against photochemical degradation through silica deposition, whilst retaining strong fluorescence quantum yields and their size dependent optical properties. Ordered 3D and 2D arrays of a macroscopic size with uniform particle spacing can be created. Thin colloid films can also be created with well-defined interparticle spacing, allowing controlled coupling of exciton and surface plasmon modes to be investigated.

	abstract = {Photocatalytic H2 production from water splitting using semiconductor photocatalysts has attracted much attention due to the increasing global energy crisis. In the past few decades, numerous photocatalysts have been proposed, however, it is still a challenge to develop highly active photocatalysts for water splitting under visible light. Here we report a new composite material consisting of Cu0.02In0.3ZnS1.47 (CIZS) nanospheres and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets as a highly active photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution under visible light. These composites were prepared through a solvothermal method in which rGO nanosheets served as a supporting material to load CIZS nanospheres. The nanocomposites demonstrated a high H2 production rate of 3.8 mmol h-1 g-1, which is about 1.84 times that of pure CIZS nanospheres under visible-light irradiation. The high H2 production rate arose from the presence of graphene, which served as an electron collector and transporter to efficiently lengthen the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers from CIZS nanospheres. This study presents an effective approach to synthesize graphene-based nanocomposites in the field of energy conversion.},

The anodized Cu2O served as the seeding sites for the growth of CuO nanowires. The embedment of CuO nanowires within the Cu2O matrix enhanced the adhesion of the nanowires onto the Cu substrate. In addition, the presence of CuO nanowires on the outer layer of the composite film, in turn stabilized the Cu2O layer by passivating the redox activities of Cu2O when exposed to the environment. This nanostructured p-type Cu2O photoelectrode generated 360 [small mu ]A cm-2 of photocathodic current density upon visible light illumination and managed to retain its photocathodic current density after being used and kept for one month. The improvement in photoelectrochemical (PEC) stability by introducing a passive layer of CuO nanowires provides useful insights into the development of a Cu2O photoelectrode, as its stability remained as the main challenge.},

	abstract = {The deposition of plasma polymer coatings onto porous alumina (PA) membranes was investigated with the aim of adjusting the surface chemistry and the pore size of the membranes. PA membranes from commercial sources with a range of pore diameters (20, 100 and 200 nm) were used and modified by plasma polymerization using n -heptylamine (HA) monomer, which resulted in a chemically reactive polymer surface with amino groups. Heptylamine plasma polymer (HAPP) layers with a thickness less than the pore diameter do not span the pores but reduce their diameter. Accordingly, by adjusting the deposition time and thus the thickness of the plasma polymer coating, it is feasible to produce any desired pore diameter. The structural and chemical properties of modified membranes were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and x-ray electron spectroscopy (XPS). The resultant PA membranes with specific surface chemistry and controlled pore size are applicable for molecular separation, cell culture, bioreactors, biosensing, drug delivery, and engineering complex composite membranes.},

Although the formal potentials for reducing Cu oxides are much higher (E = 0.522 V (SHE) for Cu+ and E = 0.340 V (SHE) for Cu2+) than CO2 reduction, CO2 reduction products are observed for short time periods ({\textless}10 minutes) in batch reactors. Electrodeposited Cu(I) electrodes showed the highest CH3OH yields near 43 µmol cm-2 hr-1 with Faradaic efficiencies near 38\%.

In this work, we examine the yield behavior of an electrodeposited cuprous oxide thin film and explore relationships between surface chemistry and reaction behavior relative to air-oxidized and anodized Cu electrodes. CH3OH yields (43 μmol cm−2 h−1) and Faradaic efficiencies (38\%) observed at cuprous oxide electrodes were remarkably higher than air-oxidized or anodized Cu electrodes suggesting Cu(I) species may play a critical role in selectivity to CH3OH. Experimental results also show CH3OH yields are dynamic and the copper oxides are reduced to metallic Cu in a simultaneous process. Yield behavior is discussed in comparison with photoelectrochemical and hydrogenation reactions where the improved stability of Cu(I) species may allow continuous CH3OH generation.},

The ligands were obtained by reductive amination of 1-methyl-1,4-diazepane with the corresponding aldehyde. Complexes 3 and 4 were obtained by the reaction of [MO2Cl2(dme)n] (M = Mo, n = 0; W, n = 1) with the corresponding ligand in presence of a base, whereas for the preparation of 1 and 2 the ligands were deprotonated by KH prior to the addition to the metal. They were characterized by NMR and IR spectroscopy, by cyclic voltammetry, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis and by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Solid-state structures of the molybdenum and tungsten cis-dioxo complexes reveal hexa-coordinate metal centers surrounded by two oxo groups, a chloride ligand and by the tridentate monophenolate ligand which coordinates meridionally through its [ONN] donor set. In the series of compounds 1-4, complexes 3 and 4 have been used as catalysts for the oxygen atom transfer reaction between dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and trimethyl phosphine (PMe3). Surprisingly, faster oxygen atom transfer (OAT) reactivity has been observed for the tungsten complex [WO2Cl(L2)] (4) in comparison to its molybdenum analog [MoO2Cl(L2)] (3) at room temperature. The kinetic results are discussed and compared in terms of their reactivity.},

	abstract = {Nicotinate dehydrogenase (NDH) from Eubacterium barkeri is a molybdoenzyme catalyzing the hydroxylation of nicotinate to 6-hydroxynicotinate. Reactivity of NDH critically depends on the presence of labile (nonselenocysteine) selenium with an as-yet-unidentified form and function. We have determined the crystal structure of NDH and analyzed its active site by multiple wavelengths anomalous dispersion methods. We show that selenium is bound as a terminal MoSe ligand to molybdenum and that it occupies the position of the terminal sulfido ligand in other molybdenum hydroxylases. The role of selenium in catalysis has been assessed by model calculations, which indicate an acceleration of the critical hydride transfer from the substrate to the selenido ligand in the course of substrate hydroxylation when compared with an active site containing a sulfido ligand. The MoO(OH)Se active site of NDH shows a novel type of utilization and reactivity of selenium in nature.},

These enzymes share common structural features, but reveal different polypeptide folding topologies and different active site coordination geometries, which, in part, dictate their function and specificity. On the basis of structural, spectroscopic and biochemical characteristics, they have been classified into three broad families named according to well-studied enzymes of each family: xanthine oxidase, sulfite oxidase and DMSO reductase. An overview of the X-ray crystallography data for representative members of the three enzyme families is given here, focusing on the mechanistic implications drawn from the structural data.},

We describe an air electrode based on a porous material coated with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), which acts as an O2 reduction catalyst. Continuous operation for 1500 hours was demonstrated without material degradation or deterioration in performance. O2 conversion rates were comparable with those of Pt-catalyzed electrodes of the same geometry, and the electrode was not sensitive to CO. Operation was demonstrated as an air electrode and as a dissolved O2 electrode in aqueous solution.},

It is of great interest to be able to transform the sample in a spatially localized manner, which may lead to many applications like 2D and 3D data storage, anti-counterfeiting protection, novel design bio-sensors and, potentially, to fabrication of metamaterials, 3D photonic crystals or plasmonic devices. Here we demonstrate irreversible spatially confined infrared-laser-induced annealing (LIA) achieved in a thin layer of dried colloidal solution of ultra-small ∼8 nm NaYF 4 nanocrystals (NCs) co-doped with 2\% Er 3+ and 20\% Yb 3+ ions under a localized tightly focused beam from a continuous wave 976 nm medium power laser diode excitation. The LIA results from self-heating due to non-radiative relaxation accompanying the NIR laser energy upconversion in lanthanide ions. We notice that localized LIA appears at optical power densities as low as 15.5 kW cm −2 (∼354 ± 29 mW) threshold in spots of 54 ± 3 µm diameter obtained with a10 × microscope objective. In the course of detailed studies, a complete recrystallization to different phases and giant 2–3 order enhancement in luminescence yield is found. Our results are highly encouraging and let us conclude that the upconverting ultra-small lanthanide-doped nanophosphors are particularly promising for direct laser writing applications.},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.0801290105},
	abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a kinetically and thermodynamically stable molecule. It is easily formed by the oxidation of organic molecules, during combustion or respiration, but is difficult to reduce. The production of reduced carbon compounds from CO2 is an attractive proposition, because carbon-neutral energy sources could be used to generate fuel resources and sequester CO2 from the atmosphere. However, available methods for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 require excessive overpotentials (are energetically wasteful) and produce mixtures of products. Here, we show that a tungsten-containing formate dehydrogenase enzyme (FDH1) adsorbed to an electrode surface catalyzes the efficient electrochemical reduction of CO2 to formate. Electrocatalysis by FDH1 is thermodynamically reversible—only small overpotentials are required, and the point of zero net catalytic current defines the reduction potential. It occurs under thoroughly mild conditions, and formate is the only product. Both as a homogeneous catalyst and on the electrode, FDH1 catalyzes CO2 reduction with a rate more than two orders of magnitude faster than that of any known catalyst for the same reaction. Formate oxidation is more than five times faster than CO2 reduction. Thermodynamically, formate and hydrogen are oxidized at similar potentials, so formate is a viable energy source in its own right as well as an industrially important feedstock and a stable intermediate in the conversion of CO2 to methanol and methane. FDH1 demonstrates the feasibility of interconverting CO2 and formate electrochemically, and it is a template for the development of robust synthetic catalysts suitable for practical applications.},

Similar sized CIS cores and CIS/ZnS core/shells, which were confirmed by TEM, showed that cation exchange occurred inside the core, which reduced the core size and increased the blue-shift in their emission. ICP revealed the CIS cores to have a gradient composition that is richer in indium close to the surface of the core, which explains the broad emission spectrum. This cation exchange reaction could be applied to AgInS2 (AIS) QDs, which showed a blue shift of 70 nm in the emission spectrum. The PXRD pattern also showed a peak shift as evidence of a core/shell structure.},

	abstract = {Iron oxide nanoparticles with superparamagnetic properties (SIONPs) have demonstrated the great capability to separate heavy metals from contaminated aqueous system, e.g., river, ground water, etc. To date, thermal decomposition methods are commonly used to synthesize highly crystalline monodisperse SIONPs with various shapes (e.g., spherical and cubic). However, the produced SIONPs show very poor dispersibility and stability in aqueous media. Thus, it is important to produce hydrophilic SIONPs by modifying the surface of iron oxide nanoparticles. Here, highly mono-dispersed iron oxide nanocubes (IONCs) were synthesized by a modified thermal decomposition approach. Following that, the oleic acid ligand was then replaced by 11-Mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) through a ligand exchange method. By control the growth of crystals, we are able to produce nanocubes that can be well dispersed in aqueous media. The average length for the edges of IONCs was estimated at 8 nm. The successful ligand replacement was proved by the spectra of FTIR. Furthermore, the thiol group presenting on the surface of nanocubes enable the functionalized IONCs as the excellent sorbent materials for extraction of heavy metal and actinide contaminants from environmental and clinical samples.},

Its sensing behavior toward various metal ions in neutral aqueous solution was investigated by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. RhB-pMOSal exhibited a reversible and sensitive “turn-on” response of absorption and fluorescence toward Cu 2+ in aqueous acetonitrile solution. Approximate 65 and 6-fold enhancement in the absorbance at 556 nm and fluorescence intensity at 573 nm were estimated when equivalent Cu 2+ was added to the RhB-pMOSal solution. Under the same conditions, RhB-pMOSal displayed more sensitive than a reported analogue RhB-Sal to Cu 2+ ion. The competition experiments for Cu 2+ mixed with common metal ions exhibited no obvious change in absorption and emission except Cr 3+ ion that can induce the fluorescence quenching of RhB-pMOSal to some extent.},

Because they are water-immiscible, MNPs are unsuitable for water-based biomedical applications. Ligand exchange reactions that transform oil- into water-dispersed MNPs have attracted considerable attention, but are difficult to perform. In this paper, we report the successful preparation of size-controlled and highly water-dispersed MNPs, which have 4, 8 and 20 nm diameter by a unique two-step ligand exchange reaction. As temporary ligands, we selected thiomalic acid (TMA), which possesses moderate affinity toward MNPs and is soluble in both oil and water to remove fatty acids by XANES analyses. Next we selected the citric acids as secondary ligands for TMA-exchanged MNPs to be highly dispersed in water to remove TMA from the surface of MNPs. And the resulting highly water-dispersed MNPs are expected to be available as MRI contrast agents and hyperthermia carriers.},

Electrospinning occurs when the electrical forces at the surface of a polymer solution or melt
overcome the surface tension and cause an electrically charged jet to be ejected. When the jet dries

accelerated by electrical forces and then collected in sheets or other useful geometrical forms.

More than 20 polymers, including polyethylene oxide, nylon, polyimide, DNA, polyaramid, and
polyaniline, have been electrospun in our laboratory. Most were spun from solution, although
spinning from the melt in vacuum and air was also demonstrated. Electrospinning from polymer melts
in a vacuum is advantageous because higher fields and higher temperatures can be used than in air.},

The nanofibrillar morphology does not require any template or surfactant, and appears to be intrinsic to polyaniline synthesized in water. Two approaches-interfacial polymerization and rapidly-mixed reactions-have been developed to prepare pure nanofibers. The key is suppressing the secondary growth that leads to agglomerated particles. The effects of different dopant acids and solvents are discussed. Changing the dopant acid can be used to tune the diameters of the nanofibers between about 30 and 120 nm. Changing the organic solvent in interfacial polymerization reactions has little effect on the product. A brief discussion of the processibility of the nanofibers is presented. The possibility of creating nanofibrillar structures for selected polyaniline derivatives is also demonstrated.},

This method entails synthesis of the desired material within the pores of a nanoporous membrane.

We synthesized a chemically modified n-type TiO2 by controlled combustion of Ti metal in a natural gas flame. This material, in which carbon substitutes for some of the lattice oxygen atoms, absorbs light at wavelengths below 535 nanometers and has a lower band-gap energy than rutile (2.32 versus 3.00 electron volts). At an applied potential of 0.3 volt, chemically modified n-type TiO2 performs water splitting with a total conversion efficiency of 11\% and a maximum photoconversion efficiency of 8.35\% when illuminated at 40 milliwatts per square centimeter. The latter value compares favorably with a maximum photoconversion efficiency of 1\% for n-type TiO2biased at 0.6 volt.},

The scanning electron microscope and atomic force microscope images show that the PANI[middle dot]CSA-PLA film is assembled from about 200 nm-diameter nanofibers, with a generally uniform thickness of about 2 [small mu ]m. The three-dimensional porous fibrous PANI[middle dot]CSA-PLA films indicate good electrocatalytic performance for I3-/I- electrolyte, demonstrated by electrochemical impedance spectra and cyclic voltammetry measurements. The photoelectric conversion efficiency of the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) firstly based on such rigid and flexible PANI[middle dot]CSA-PLA counter electrodes achieves 5.3\% and 3.1\% under 1 sun illumination of 100 mW cm-2 (AM 1.5), respectively, which is close to that of sputtered Pt-based DSCs. In addition, the rigid PANI[middle dot]CSA-PLA-based DSC demonstrates good stability. As the PANI[middle dot]CSA-PLA counter electrodes can be obtained in a short time at room temperature, they are potentially applicable in large-area DSCs and suitable for flexible DSCs.},

	abstract = {Nanoparticle electrophoretic translocation through a single nanopore induces a detectable change in the ionic current, which enables the nanopore-based sensing for various bio-analytical applications. In this study, a transient continuum-based model is developed for the first time to investigate the electrokinetic particle translocation through a nanopore by solving the Nernst-Planck equations for the ionic concentrations, the Poisson equation for the electric potential and the Navier-Stokes equations for the flow field using an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method. When the applied electric field is relatively low, a current blockade is expected. In addition, the particle could be trapped at the entrance of the nanopore when the electrical double layer (EDL) adjacent to the charged particle is relatively thick. When the electric field imposed is relatively high, the particle can always pass through the nanopore by electrophoresis. However, a current enhancement is predicted if the EDL of the particle is relatively thick. The obtained numerical results qualitatively agree with the existing experimental results. It is also found that the initial orientation of the particle could significantly affect the particle translocation and the ionic current through a nanopore. Furthermore, a relatively high electric field tends to align the particle with its longest axis parallel to the local electric field. However, the particle's initial lateral offset from the centerline of the nanopore acts as a minor effect.},

	abstract = {Nanopores have emerged as promising next-generation devices for DNA sequencing technology. The two major challenges in such devices are: (i) find an efficient way to raise the DNA capture rate prior to funnelling a nanopore, and (ii) reduce the translocation velocity inside it so that single base resolution can be attained efficiently. To achieve these, a novel soft nanopore comprising a solid-state nanopore and a functionalized soft layer is proposed to regulate the DNA electrokinetic translocation. We show that, in addition to the presence of an electroosmotic flow (EOF), which reduces the DNA translocation velocity, counterion concentration polarization (CP) occurs near the entrance of the nanopore. The latter establishes an enrichment of the counterion concentration field, thereby electrostatically enhancing the capture rate. The dependence of the ionic current on the bulk salt concentration, the soft layer properties, and the length of the nanopore are investigated. We show that if the salt concentration is low, the ionic current depends largely upon the length of the nanopore, and the density of the fixed charge of the soft layer, but not upon its degree of softness. On the other hand, if it is high, ionic current blockade always occurs, regardless of the levels of the other parameters. The proposed soft nanopore is capable of enhancing the performance of DNA translocation while maintaining its basic signature of the ionic current at high salt concentration. The results gathered provide the necessary information for designing devices used in DNA sequencing.},

	abstract = {Similar to the way that atoms bond to form molecules and crystalline structures, colloidal nanocrystals can be combined together to form larger assemblies. The properties of these structures are determined by the properties of individual nanocrystals and by their interactions. The insulating nature of organic ligands typically used in nanocrystal synthesis results in very poor interparticle coupling. We found that various molecular metal chalcogenide complexes can serve as convenient ligands for colloidal nanocrystals and nanowires. These ligands can be converted into semiconducting phases upon gentle heat treatment, generating inorganic nanocrystal solids. The utility of the inorganic ligands is demonstrated for model systems, including highly conductive arrays of gold nanocrystals capped with Sn2S64– ions and field-effect transistors on cadmium selenide nanocrystals.},

The colloidal solution displays size-dependent quantum confinement behavior in the absorption and photoluminescence spectra. The average size of the nanocrystals can be increased from 2 to 4 nm by raising the reaction temperature from 200 °C to 250 °C. The nanoparticles are capped with hexanethiol ligands; these ligands can be exchanged with trioctylphosphine oxide or pyridine. The nature of the surface-capping ligands has a significant effect on the photoluminescence emission intensity. Investigation of the effect of synthesis parameters and postsynthesis treatments on the optical properties of the nanocrystals leads to the conclusion that the room-temperature emission originates in donor−acceptor defects.},

	abstract = {Phthalocyanine-nanoparticle conjugates have been designed and synthesised for the delivery of hydrophobic photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer. The phthalocyanine photosensitizer stabilized gold nanoparticles have an average diameter of 2-4 nm. The synthetic strategy interdigitates a phase transfer reagent between phthalocyanine molecules on the particle surface that solubilises the hydrophobic photosensitizer in polar solvents enabling delivery of the nanoparticle conjugates to cells. The phthalocyanine is present in the monomeric form on the nanoparticle surface, absorbs radiation maximally at 695 nm and catalytically produces the cytotoxic species singlet oxygen with high efficiency. These properties suggest that the phthalocyanine-nanoparticle conjugates are ideally suited for PDT. In a process that can be considered as cancer therapy using a 'Trojan horse', when the nanoparticle conjugates are incubated with HeLa cells (a cervical cancer cell line), they are taken up thus delivering the phthalocyanine photosensitizer directly into the cell interior. Irradiation of the nanoparticle conjugates within the HeLa cells induced substantial cell mortality through the photodynamic production of singlet oxygen. The PDT efficiency of the nanoparticle conjugates, determined using colorimetric assay, was twice that obtained using the free phthalocyanine derivative. Following PDT with the nanoparticle conjugates, morphological changes to the HeLa cellular structure were indicative of cell mortality apoptosis. Further evidence of apoptosis was provided through the bioluminescent assay detection of caspase 3/7. Our results suggest that gold nanoparticle conjugates are an excellent vehicle for the delivery of surface bound hydrophobic photosensitizers for efficacious photodynamic therapy of cultured tumour cells.},

Anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies were covalently bound to the nanoparticles via a terminal carboxy moiety on the polyethylene glycol. The nanoparticle conjugates were stable towards aggregation, and under irradiation with visible red light efficiently produced cytotoxic singlet oxygen.

CdTe and CdSe nanoparticles mixed with a mercury cation were transformed into alloyed anisotropic structures with red-shifted optical properties. Additionally the same cation addition to CdSe nanorods caused oriented attachment and resulted in a series of end-to-end superstructures. In the case of gold cation addition, CdTe nanoparticles yielded gold based anisotropic structures which had poor solubility in the original solvent. CdTe nanoparticles mixed with lead, zinc and cadmium cations, however, kept their original optical properties after the same reaction procedure. Combining these observations with the previously reported chemical transformation from cadmium chalcogenides to silver/copper chalcogenides, we highlight the role of the redox potentials when describing the change in structural/optical property in colloidal cadmium chalcogenide nanocrystals.},

	abstract = {A new approach to overcome chloride interferences in the photoelectrochemical determination of chemical oxygen demand (PeCOD[trade mark sign]) was developed. This approach was based on the kinetic characteristics of photocatalytic oxidation reactions of chloride in the presence and absence of organics. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was evaluated using the newly developed PeCOD[trade mark sign] system with a wide range of possible scenarios. It was found that the chloride interference was insignificant when a sample meets the two critical criteria, i.e., chloride concentration [less-than-or-equal]26.6 ppm and the concentration ratio of chloride to organics [less-than-or-equal]5 : 1 (ppm Cl-/ppm COD). The Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) of such a sample can be directly determined by the direct PeCOD[trade mark sign] method. When the chloride content in a sample exceeds 26.6 ppm, an appropriate sample dilution could effectively reduce the chloride interference to less than 5\%, if the diluted sample meets the critical criteria. An organic addition method was proposed to deal with scenarios for samples containing high chloride and low organic concentrations where the critical criteria cannot be met by simple dilution. Such an approach greatly extends the applicability of the proposed method, covering a wide range of possible real-world scenarios without the need to use expensive (i.e. AgNO3) and toxic (i.e. HgSO4) masking reagents.},

	abstract = {The present work is focussed on the principles of photodynamic therapy (PDT), emphasizing the photochemical mechanisms of reactive oxygen species formation and the consequent biochemical processes generated by the action of reactive oxygen species on various biological macromolecules and organelles. This paper also presents some of the most used photosensitizers, including Photofrin, and the new prototypes of photosensitizers, analysing their physicochemical and spectroscopic properties. At this point, the review discusses the therapeutic window of absorption of specific wavelengths involving first- and second-generation photosensitizers, as well as the principal light sources used in PDT. Additionally, the aggregation process, which consists in a phenomenon common to several photosensitizers, is studied. J-aggregates and H-aggregates are discussed, along with their spectroscopic effects. Most photosensitizers have a significant hydrophobic character; thus, the study of the types of aggregation in aqueous solvent is very relevant. Important aspects of the coordination chemistry of metalloporphyrins and metallophthalocyanines used as photosensitizers are also discussed. The state-of-the-art in PDT is evaluated, discussing recent articles in this area. Furthermore, macrocyclic photosensitizers, such as porphyrins and phthalocyanines, are specifically described. The present review is an important contribution, because PDT is one of the most auspicious advances in the therapy against cancer and other non-malignant diseases.},

Especially, the nanorods obtained under a Cu/In raw material ratio of 2 : 1 with the assistance of both dodecanethiol and oleic acid have good uniformity. They could further assemble into large-scale superlattices on substrates by solvent evaporation method. On the other hand, the optical property studies of the nanocrystals show that the band gap of wurtzite CuInS2 is 1.63 eV, which is optimal for solar cell applications. This report provides valuable insight into the controlled synthesis of ternary I-III-VI2 semiconductors and the assembly process, packing them into oriented films.},

The size-sorting experiments on CIS/ZnS QDs indicated that the ZnS shell was formed with a relatively uniform thickness even though the size of pre-existing CIS core QDs was not monodisperse. CIS core QDs solvothermally grown for different reaction times of 5-6 h exhibited poor QYs of {\textless}8.8\% with deep red emissions as a result of donor-acceptor pair (DAP) recombination. Upon shell overcoating, the band gap energies of CIS/ZnS QDs increased by 0.14-0.23 eV, depending on the CIS core growth time. Such increased band gaps were attributed presumably to the reduction of actual CIS core size, originating from the formation of the alloyed interfacial layer at CIS/ZnS during a long shell growth. Compared to CIS core QDs, the emission of CIS/ZnS QDs was markedly blue-shifted by 0.10-0.18 eV. This blue-shift was discussed based on the shift of QD band gap-dependent donor/acceptor energy levels and the donor-acceptor distance-dependent DAP recombination process.},

Conjugates with mAb/chlorin molar ratios as high as 1:36 retained mAb binding activity, and the absorption spectrum and quantum efficiency for singlet oxygen production of bound chlorin (0.7 +/- 0.2) were unchanged from that of the free photosensitizer. Phototoxicity, as measured by a clonogenic assay and by uptake of ethidium bromide, was dependent on the doses of both mAb-chlorin and 630- to 670-nm light, was enhanced by 2H2O, and was observed only in target populations that bound the mAb. Similarly, free chlorin e6 in solution had no photodynamic effect in amounts 100 times more than that carried by the mAb. For this antibody-targeted system, approximately 10(10) molecules of singlet oxygen were necessary to kill a cell.},

Three different bifunctional linker molecules have been used to attach colloidal QDs to the TiO 2 surface: mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), thioglycolic acid (TGA), and cysteine. The linker molecule plays a determinant role in the solar cell performance, as illustrated by the fact that the incident photon to charge carrier generation efficiency (IPCE) could be improved by a factor of 5–6 by using cysteine with respect to MPA. The photovoltaic properties of QD sensitized electrodes have been characterized for both three-electrode and closed two-electrode solar cell configurations. For three-electrode measurement a maximum power conversion efficiency near 1\% can be deduced, but this efficiency is halved in the closed cell configuration mainly due to the decrease of the fill factor (FF).},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is the most promising fuel of the future owing to its carbon-free, high-energy content and potential to be efficiently converted into either electrical or thermal energy. The greatest technical barrier to accessing this renewable resource remains the inability to create inexpensive catalysts for the solar-driven oxidation of water. To date, the most efficient system that uses solar energy to oxidize water is the photosystem II water-oxidizing complex (PSII-WOC), which is found within naturally occurring photosynthetic organisms. The catalytic core of this enzyme is a CaMn4Ox cluster, which is present in all known species of oxygenic phototrophs and has been conserved since the emergence of this type of photosynthesis about 2.5 billion years ago. The key features that facilitate the catalytic success of the PSII-WOC offer important lessons for the design of abiological water oxidation catalysts. In this Account, we examine the chemical principles that may govern the PSII-WOC by comparing the water oxidation capabilities of structurally related synthetic manganese-oxo complexes, particularly those with a cubical Mn4O4 core (“cubanes”). We summarize this research, from the self-assembly of the first such clusters, through the elucidation of their mechanism of photoinduced rearrangement to release O2, to recent advances highlighting their capability to catalyze sustained light-activated electrolysis of water. The [Mn4O4]6+ cubane core assembles spontaneously in solution from monomeric precursors or from [Mn2O2]3+ core complexes in the presence of metrically appropriate bidentate chelates, for example, diarylphosphinates (ligands of Ph2PO2− and 4-phenyl-substituted derivatives), which bridge pairs of Mn atoms on each cube face (Mn4O4L6). The [Mn4O4]6+ core is enlarged relative to the [Mn2O2]3+ core, resulting in considerably weaker Mn−O bonds. Cubanes are ferocious oxidizing agents, stronger than analogous complexes with the [Mn2O2]3+ core, as demonstrated both by the range of substrates they dehydrogenate or oxygenate (unactivated alkanes, for example) and the 25\% larger O−H bond enthalpy of the resulting μ3-OH bridge. The cubane core topology is structurally suited to releasing O2, and it does so in high yield upon removal of one phosphinate by photoexcitation in the gas phase or thermal excitation in the solid state. This is quite unlike other Mn-oxo complexes and can be attributed to the elongated Mn−O bond lengths and low-energy transition state to the μ-peroxo precursor. The photoproduct, [Mn4O2L5]+, an intact nonplanar butterfly core complex, is poised for oxidative regeneration of the cubane core upon binding of two water molecules and coupling to an anode. Catalytic evolution of O2 and protons from water exceeding 1000 turnovers can be readily achieved by suspending the oxidized cubane, [Mn4O4L6]+, into a proton-conducting membrane (Nafion) preadsorbed onto a conducting electrode and electroxidizing the photoreduced butterfly complexes by the application of an external bias. Catalytic water oxidation can be achieved using sunlight as the only source of energy by replacing the external electrical bias with redox coupling to a photoanode incorporating a Ru(bipyridyl) dye.},

The solution of lanthanum methoxyethoxide and aluminum methoxyethoxide in 2-methoxyethanol was prepared via ligand exchange starting from lanthanum isopropoxide and aluminum sec-butoxide and was used to make both LaAlO3 powders and films. Complete hydrolysis of the solution formed a gel that yielded well-crystallized LaAlO3 powders when fired in air at 800 °C. A partially hydrolyzed solution was spun-cast on SrTiO3 (100) single crystal substrates. Epitaxial films of LaAlO3 were subsequently formed during pyrolysis in O2 at 800 °C in a rapid thermal annealing furnace for a total of 8 min. The films were strongly c-axis oriented, verified by x-ray rocking curve results from the (003) plane with full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) = 0.87°, and had good in-plane texture shown by a φ scan of the (202) plane with FWHM = 1.07°.},

Assembling nanoparticles generates new nonostructures, which have unforeseen collective, intrinsic physical properties. These properties con be exploited for multipurpose applications in nanoelectronics, spintronics, sensors, etc. This review surveys different techniques, currently employed and being developed, for assembling nanoparticles in to ordered nanostructures. In this endeavour, the principles and methods involved in the development of assemblies are discussed. Subsequently, different possibilities of nanoparticle-based nanostructures, obtained in multi-dimensions, are presented},

	abstract = {Because of the increasing resistance of bacteria to antibiotics there is considerable interest in light-activated antimicrobial agents (LAAAs) as alternatives to antibiotics for treating localized infections. The purpose of this study was to determine whether CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QD) could enhance the antibacterial activity of the LAAA, toluidine blue O (TBO). Suspensions of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes were exposed to white light (3600 lux) and TBO (absorbance maximum = 630 nm) in the presence and absence of 25 nm diameter QD (emission maximum = 627 nm). When the TBO:QD ratio was 2667:1, killing of Staph. aureus was enhanced by 1.72log 10 units. In the case of Strep. pyogenes , an enhanced kill of 1.55log 10 units was achieved using TBO and QD in the ratio 267:1. Singlet oxygen and fluorescence measurements showed that QD suppress the formation of singlet oxygen from TBO and that QD fluorescence is significantly quenched in the presence of TBO (70–90\%). Enhanced killing appears to be attributable to a non-Förster resonance energy transfer mechanism, whereby the QD converts part of the incident light to the absorption maximum for TBO; hence more light energy is harvested, resulting in increased concentrations of bactericidal radicals. QD may, therefore, be useful in improving the efficacy of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy.},

Hydrogenase was adsorbed to pyrolytic graphite edge and carbon felt electrodes. Cyclic voltammograms of the immobilized hydrogenase films reveal cathodic proton reduction and anodic hydrogen oxidation, with a catalytic bias toward hydrogen evolution. When corrected for the electrochemically active surface area, the cathodic current densities are similar for both carbon electrodes, and 40\% of those obtained with a platinum electrode. The high surface area carbon felt/hydrogenase electrode was subsequently used as the cathode in a photoelectrochemical biofuel cell. Under illumination, this device is able to oxidize a biofuel substrate and reduce protons to hydrogen. Similar photocurrents and hydrogen production rates were observed in the photoelectrochemical biofuel cell using either hydrogenase or platinum cathodes.},

Such “greener” approaches also allowed the reaction temperatures to be below 200 °C. By introducing reactivity-controlling ligands for Cu, namely thiols, control of the Cu:In stoichiometric ratio in the nanocrystals was achieved. Amines were identified as catalytic reagents for the rapid oxidation of the CuInS2 nanocrystals, which could be prevented by the formation of CuInS2/ZnS core/shell nanocrystals by a one-pot approach. CuInS2/ZnS core/shell nanocrystals also showed greatly improved optical properties, with photoluminescence quantum yield up to about 30\% and an emission peak position tunable from 500 to 950 nm. The versatility of the synthetic strategy was demonstrated by extending it to the synthesis of AgInS2 nanocrystals by simply replacing the copper salt by a silver salt.},

	abstract = {A facile route for synthesizing CuInSe 2 nanocrystals was developed using an alkanethiol as ligand and noncoordinating octadecene as solvent. The CuInSe 2 nanoparticles and nanoplates were obtained, depending on the reaction temperature and time. When the reaction temperature was set at 180 °C and reaction for an hour, CuInSe 2 nanoparticles with an average size of 6.2 nm were produced. As the reaction time was prolonged to 3 h, nanoplates appeared inside the nanoparticles. When the reaction temperature was elevated to 210 °C and reaction for 3 h, triangular or hexagonal CuInSe 2 nanoplates with sharp edges were synthesized. It was proposed that the Ostwald ripening induced the morphology evolution of the CuInSe 2 nanoparticles into nanoplates at the higher temperature. The nanoparticles and nanoplates were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED), x-ray diffraction (XRD) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The UV–vis absorption spectra of the CuInSe 2 nanoparticles were significantly blue-shifted in comparison with the bulk material due to the quantum confinement.},

However, for nanoscopic particles, thermal fluctuations compete with interfacial energy and give rise to a particle-size–dependent self-assembly. Ligand-stabilized nanoparticles assembled into three-dimensional constructs at fluid-fluid interfaces, where the properties unique to the nanoparticles were preserved. The small size of the nanoparticles led to a weak confinement of the nanoparticles at the fluid interface that opens avenues to size-selective particle assembly, two-dimensional phase behavior, and functionalization. Fluid interfaces afford a rapid approach to equilibrium and easy access to nanoparticles for subsequent modification. A photoinduced transformation is described in which nanoparticles, initially soluble only in toluene, were transported across an interface into water and were dispersed in the water phase. The characteristic fluorescence emission of the nanoparticles provided a direct probe of their spatial distribution.},

This paper focuses on the recent developments in the utilization of semiconductor quantum dots for light energy conversion. Three major ways to utilize semiconductor dots in solar cell include (i) metal−semiconductor or Schottky junction photovoltaic cell (ii) polymer−semiconductor hybrid solar cell, and (iii) quantum dot sensitized solar cell. Modulation of band energies through size control offers new ways to control photoresponse and photoconversion efficiency of the solar cell. Various strategies to maximize photoinduced charge separation and electron transfer processes for improving the overall efficiency of light energy conversion are discussed. Capture and transport of charge carriers within the semiconductor nanocrystal network to achieve efficient charge separation at the electrode surface remains a major challenge. Directing the future research efforts toward utilization of tailored nanostructures will be an important challenge for the development of next generation solar cells.},

Heating appropriate amounts of Cu, In, Ga and Se dispersed in an aqueous solution containing mercapto-acetic acid in a microwave oven gives rise to small and uniform nanoparticles. These new materials have been characterized to confirm composition, geometrical and structural properties. Transmission electron microcopy (TEM) confirmed size distribution around 4 nm. XRD confirmed the chalcopyrite structure with an average crystallite size of 3 nm. Atomic concentration and oxidation states of the different elements have been investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). UV-visible absorption characterization confirmed the tunable optical properties of these materials. The proposed synthesis is scalable for commercial production with minimal environmental impact.},

	abstract = {We report on a high-performance photoelectrode consisting of a nanocrystalline TiO2 film co-sensitized with CuInS2 quantum dots (QDs) and CdS layers. In this photoelectrode, solvothermally synthesized CuInS2 QDs, monodispersed at sizes of 3.5 and 4.3 nm, are attached to a TiO2 substrate by means of a bifunctional linker, before it is coated with an in situ growth of CdS followed by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction. The QDs has a high-level conduction band for the efficient injection of electrons into TiO2. The CdS coating provides high surface coverage to prevent interfacial recombination and releases the quantum confinement of the QDs, resulting in band gap reduction from 2.10-1.80 eV and 1.94-1.76 eV for the 3.5 and 4.3 nm QDs, respectively. With AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm-2, this heterostructural electrode exhibits a saturated photocurrent as high as 16 mA cm-2 in a polysulfide solution. Systematic analysis suggests that the photocurrent resulting from the CuInS2 QDs is increased by more than 100\%, thanks to the CdS coating. This coating extends the absorption spectra of the QDs and facilitates charge separation by scavenging photogenerated holes in the valence band of the QDs.},

Complete and fully reversible exchange occurs, and the rates of the reactions are much faster than in bulk cation exchange processes. A critical size has been identified below which the shapes of complex nanocrystals evolve toward the equilibrium shape with lowest energy during the exchange reaction. Above the critical size, the anion sublattice remains intact and the basic shapes of the initial nanocrystals are retained throughout the cation exchange. The size-dependent shape change can also be used to infer features of the microscopic mechanism.},

Deposition of the Co-Pi catalyst on the Indium Tin Oxide (ITO)-passivated p-side of a np-Si junction enables the majority of the voltage generated by the solar cell to be utilized for driving the water-splitting reaction. Operation under neutral pH conditions fosters enhanced stability of the anode as compared to operation under alkaline conditions (pH 14) for which long-term stability is much more problematic. This demonstration of a simple, robust construct for photo-assisted water splitting is an important step towards the development of inexpensive direct solar-to-fuel energy conversion technologies.},

	abstract = {Colloidal quantum dot light-emitting devices (QD-LEDs) have generated considerable interest for applications such as thin film displays with improved color saturation and white lighting with a high color rendering index (CRI). We review the key advantages of using quantum dots (QDs) in display and lighting applications, including their color purity, solution processability, and stability. After highlighting the main developments in QD-LED technology in the past 15 years, we describe the three mechanisms for exciting QDs - optical excitation, Fo¨ rster energy transfer, and direct charge injection - that have been leveraged to create QD-LEDs. We outline the challenges facing QDLED development, such as QD charging and QD luminescence quenching in QD thin films. We describe how optical downconversion schemes have enabled researchers to overcome these challenges and develop commercial lighting products that incorporate QDs to achieve desirable color temperature and a high CRI while maintaining efficiencies comparable to inorganic white LEDs ({\textgreater}65 lumens per Watt). We conclude by discussing some current directions in QD research that focus on achieving higher efficiency and air-stable QD-LEDs using electrical excitation of the luminescent QDs.

The hybrid solar cells based on the obtained spherical CdSe NCs as an acceptor and Poly(2-methoxy-5-(2'-ethylhexoxy)- p -phenylenevinylene) (MEH-PPV) as a donor show an energy conversion efficiency (ECE) as high as 0.85\%, three times higher than that reported before for spherical CdSe NCs/conjugated polymer hybrid solar cells. When poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is used as the donor phase instead of MEH-PPV, the energy conversion efficiency increases up to 1.08\%. The solar cell based on CdSe NCs/conjugated polymer has the potential to open up new production technologies for hybrid solar cells based on semiconductor NCs.},

	abstract = {Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has become an increasingly recognized alternative to cancer treatment in clinic. However, PDT therapy agents, namely photosensitizer (PS), are limited in application as a result of prolonged cutaneous photosensitivity, poor water solubility and inadequate selectivity, which are encountered by numerous chemical therapies. Magnetic chitosan nanoparticles provide excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, non-toxicity and water solubility without compromising their magnetic targeting. Nevertheless, no previous attempt has been reported to develop an in vivo magnetic drug delivery system with chitosan nanoparticles for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) monitored targeting photodynamic therapy. In this study, magnetic targeting chitosan nanoparticles (MTCNPs) were prepared and tailored as a drug delivery system and imaging agents for PS, designated as PHPP. Results showed that PHPP-MTCNPs could be used in MRI monitored targeting PDT with excellent targeting and imaging ability. Non-toxicity and high photodynamic efficacy on SW480 carcinoma cells both in vitro and in vivo were achieved with this method at the level of 0–100 µM. Notably, localization of nanoparticles in skin and hepatic tissue was significantly less than in tumor tissue, therefore photosensitivity and hepatotoxicity can be attenuated.},

HeLa cells cultured in vitro were completely killed in the presence of TiO2 (50 µg/ml) with 10-min UV irradiation by a 500-W Hg lamp. In contrast, very little cell death was observed from TiO2 treatment without UV irradiation. Photoexcited TiO2 particles also significantly suppressed the growth of HeLa cells implanted in nude mice, compared with those receiving TiO2 alone or UV irradiation alone. The cell death caused by photoexcited TiO2 particles was significantly protected in the presence of l-tryptophan and catalase. These molecules are quenchers of hydroxyl radicals and scavengers of hydrogen peroxide, respectively, suggesting that the cells were killed by the OH and H2O2 produced from photoexcited TiO2 particles.},

	abstract = {Upconversion refers to non-linear optical processes that convert two or more low-energy pumpphotons to a higher-energy output photon. After being recognized in the mid-1960s, upconversion has attracted significant research interest for its applications in optical devices such as infrared quantum counter detectors and compact solid-state lasers. Over the past decade, upconversion has become more prominent in biological sciences as the preparation of high-quality lanthanide-doped nanoparticles has become increasingly routine. Owing to their small physical dimensions and biocompatibility, upconversion nanoparticles can be easily coupled to proteins or other biological macromolecular systems and used in a variety of assay formats ranging from bio-detection to cancer therapy. In addition, intense visible emission from these nanoparticles under near-infrared excitation, which is less harmful to biological samples and has greater sample penetration depths than conventional ultraviolet excitation, enhances their prospects as luminescent stains in bio-imaging. In this article, we review recent developments in optical biolabeling and bio-imaging involving upconversion nanoparticles, simultaneously bringing to the forefront the desirable characteristics, strengths and weaknesses of these luminescent nanomaterials.},

Rose bengal and chlorin e6, photosensitizers (PSs) that generate singlet oxygen in high yield, were covalently attached to phytochelatin-related peptides. The photosensitizer−peptide conjugates were subsequently used to overcoat green- and red-emitting CdSe/CdS/ZnS nanocrystals. Generation of singlet oxygen could be achieved via indirect excitation through Förster (fluorescence) resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the nanocrystals to PSs, or by direct excitation of the PSs. In the latter case, by using two color excitations, the conjugate could be simultaneously used for fluorescence imaging and singlet oxygen generation. Singlet oxygen quantum yields as high as 0.31 were achieved using 532-nm excitation wavelengths.},

	abstract = {This study reports the solvothermal synthesis of colloidal CuInS2 quantum dots (QDs) for use as sensitizers for photoelectrochemical cells. The synthesis is conducted in an autoclave containing CuCl, InCl3, and S at a Cu/In/S ratio of 1/1/100. This high sulfur-excess environment leads to burst nucleation of CuInS2 at relatively low temperatures. For synthesis conducted at 110-150 [degree]C for 1 h, the atomic ratio of the CuInS2 products is Cu : In : S = 1.1 : 1.0 : 2.1 and the particle size increases with the temperature from 3.5 to 4.3 nm, with a narrow size distribution within 7-11\%. The as-prepared colloidal CuInS2 exhibits the quantum confinement effect in the optical absorption spectra. The photoluminescence emission of the resulting CuInS2 QDs has high energy, which may result from excited electrons falling from quantized levels to the ground states. Under illumination of simulated AM 1.5 G at one sun intensity, the CuInS2-sensitized TiO2 electrodes in aqueous sulfide/sulfite electrolyte show light-to-chemical energy conversion efficiencies of 1.9\% at a +0.23 V bias and 1.2\% at short-circuit. These encouraging conversion efficiencies are attributed to the high energy state of the photoexcited electrons in the CuInS2 QDs.},

	abstract = {Nanosized objects made of various materials are gaining increasing attention as promising vehicles for the delivery of therapeutic and diagnostic agents for cancer. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) appears to offer a very attractive opportunity to implement drug delivery systems since no release of the sensitizer is needed to obtain the therapeutic effect and the design of the nanovehicle should be much easier. The aim of our study was to investigate the use of organic-modified silica nanoparticles (NPs) for the delivery of the second-generation photosensitizer meta-tetra(hydroxyphenyl)chlorin (mTHPC) to cancer cells in vitro . mTHPC was entrapped in NPs ( 33 nm diameter) in a monomeric form which produced singlet oxygen with a high efficiency. In aqueous media with high salt concentrations, the NPs underwent aggregation and precipitation but their stability could be preserved in the presence of foetal bovine serum. The cellular uptake, localization and phototoxic activity of mTHPC was determined comparatively in human oesophageal cancer cells after its delivery by the NPs and the standard solvent ethanol/poly(ethylene glycol) 400/water (20:30:50, by vol). The NP formulation reduced the cellular uptake of mTHPC by about 50\% in comparison to standard solvent while it did not affect the concentration-dependent photokilling activity of mTHPC and its intracellular localization. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements, using NPs with mTHPC physically entrapped and a cyanine covalently linked, and ultracentrifugation experiments indicated that mTHPC is transferred from NPs to serum proteins when present in the medium. However, the coating of the NP surface with poly(ethylene glycol) largely prevented the transfer to proteins. In conclusion, mTHPC is rapidly transferred from the uncoated nanoparticles to the serum proteins and then internalized by the cells as a protein complex, irrespective of its modality of delivery.},

	abstract = {We have measured the modal optical absorption spectrum of a three-layer system of InAs quantum dots in a slab waveguide geometry, observing distinct absorption peaks for the ground and excited states. The spectrally integrated absorption cross section for the ground and first excited states are determined to be σ 0 = (0.43 ± 0.1) × 10 −15 and (0.92 ± 0.2) × 10 −15 cm 2 eV, respectively. Assuming that the spectral shapes are determined primarily by the inhomogeneous size distribution of dots the Gaussian linewidths are 16 and 19 meV for the ground and first excited state transitions, respectively. The peak ground state absorption cross section is 1.1 × 10 −14 cm 2 . The ground state spectrally integrated cross section estimated by a theory with the envelope function overlap integral taken to be unity is 0.40 × 10 −15 cm 2 eV, in agreement with the measured value. We conclude that on the basis of the spectrally integrated cross section there is no evidence for a substantial reduction in the strength of the fundamental light–matter interaction in dots compared with systems of higher dimensionality.},

It is associated with renal, neurological, skeletal and other toxic effects, including reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity. There is still much to find out about its mechanisms of action, biomarkers of critical effects, and ways to reduce health risks. At present, there is no clinically efficient agent to treat cadmium poisoning due to predominantly intracellular location of cadmium ions. This article gives a brief review of cadmium-induced oxidative stress and its interactions with essential elements zinc and magnesium as relevant mechanisms of cadmium toxicity. It draws on available literature data and our own results, which indicate that dietary supplementation of either essential element has beneficial effect under condition of cadmium exposure. We have also tackled the reasons why magnesium addition prevails over zinc and discussed the protective role of magnesium during cadmium exposure. These findings could help to solve the problem of prophylaxis and therapy of increased cadmium body burden.},

However, poor tissue penetration of high-energy light and hydrophobic photosensitizers limits the effectiveness to superficial pathologies. Upconversion phosphor nanoparticles convert low-energy radiation to higher-energy emissions. Aim:To create upconverting 'nanotransducers' to enable PDT in deep tissues. RESULTS: Monodisperse, 50 nm PEI/NaYF(4):Yb(3+),Er(3+) nanoparticles producing green/red emission on near-infrared (NIR) excitation were targeted to folate receptors on human colon cancer cells and imaged with high signal-to-background ratio. It was demonstrated that these particles could be excited after deep intramuscular injection in rats. On NIR excitation, the particles, modified with zinc phthalocyanin photosensitizer, released singlet oxygen and, after targeted binding to cancer cells, resulted in significant cell destruction. CONCLUSION: Potential clinical use of these nanoparticles includes imaging and PDT of cancer in deep tissues.},

	abstract = {This paper describes research into a new approach to cancer treatment through a combination of radiation and photodynamic therapies. The assumption is that supplementing conventional radiation therapy with photodynamic therapy (PDT) will enable the use of lower doses of radiation. Under this concept, scintillation or persistent luminescence nanoparticles with attached photosensitizers such as porphyrins are used as an {\textless}I{\textgreater}in vivo{\textless}/I{\textgreater} agent for photodynamic therapy. The nanoparticle PDT agents are delivered to the treatment site. Upon exposure to ionizing radiation such as X-rays, the nanoparticles emit scintillation or persistent luminescence, which, in turn, activates the photosensitizers; as a consequence, singlet oxygen ({\textless}SUP{\textgreater}1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}O{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) is produced. Studies have shown that {\textless}SUP{\textgreater}1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}O{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} can be effective in killing cancer cells. This is the conventional way in which PDT can augment the effectiveness of ionizing radiation. The innovation described in this study involves the use of {\textless}I{\textgreater}in vivo{\textless}/I{\textgreater} luminescent nanoparticles so that an external light source is not required to support PDT. Consequently, application of the therapy can be more localized and the potential of damage to healthy cells is reduced. This new modality will provide an efficient, low-cost approach to PDT while still offering the benefits of augmented radiation therapy at lower doses.},

More recently new derivatives have become available, both porphyrin-derived and employing new chromophores, for example from the phthalocyanine and phenothiazinium families. In addition, a major research effort has been rewarded with the clinical acceptance of the porphyrin precursor 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA). New photosensitisers intended for clinical use must exhibit advantageous drug performance profiles compared to the first-generation porphyrin derivatives. This can be seen, in vitro, in improved photophysical properties such as the extension of the useful light absorption spectrum into the near infrared - offering greater tissue penetration - as well as in the synthesis of pure compounds rather than mixtures. In this review, recent developments in photosensitiser families are discussed with respect to in vitro performance indicators and to potential application in oncology. {\textless}P{\textgreater}{\textless}/P{\textgreater} {\textless}P{\textgreater}{\textless}/P{\textgreater} {\textless}P{\textgreater}{\textless}/P{\textgreater}},

We measure and report the size-dependent absorption cross section of CdSe nanocrystal quantum dots. We compare the results for absorption far above the band edge, where the quantum dot density of states may be approximated as a continuum, to simple theoretical models of light scattering from light-absorbing small particles. Excellent agreement with theory is found for dilute dispersions in hexane. We find that for absorption at 350 nm the per particle absorption cross section Cabs (in cm2) for CdSe is Cabs = (5.501 105)a3 cm-1, where a is the particle radius in cm. The absorption cross section is observed to be largely insensitive to the solvent refractive index. Detailed modeling of the effect of the ligand shell may be necessary to understand the lack of sensitivity of the absorption properties of nanocrystal quantum dots to the refractive index of the medium.},

This therapy results in a sequence of photochemical and photobiologic processes that cause irreversible photodamage to tumor tissues. Results from preclinical and clinical studies conducted worldwide over a 25-year period have established photodynamic therapy as a useful treatment approach for some cancers. Since 1993, regulatory approval for photodynamic therapy involving use of a partially purified, commercially available hematoporphyrin derivative compound (Photofrin®) in patients with early and advanced stage cancer of the lung, digestive tract, and genitourinary tract has been obtained in Canada, The Netherlands, France, Germany, Japan, and the United States. We have attempted to conduct and present a comprehensive review of this rapidly expanding field. Mechanisms of subcellular and tumor localization of photosensitizing agents, as well as of molecular, cellular, and tumor responses associated with photodynamic therapy, are discussed.

Methods: Photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to determine the particle size of antimony trisulfide and rhenium sulfide colloids, and membrane filtration (MF) was used to determine the radioactive particle size distribution of the corresponding 99mTc-labeled colloids. Results: Antimony trisulfide was found to have a diameter of 9.3 \{+/-\} 3.6 nm by TEM and 18.7 \{+/-\} 0.2 nm by PCS. Rhenium sulfide colloid was found to exist as an essentially trimodal sample with a dv(max1) of 40.3 nm, a dv(max2) of 438.6 nm, and a dv of 650-2200 nm, where dv is volume diameter. 99mTc-antimony trisulfide by MF showed that more than 96\% of radioactive particles were smaller than 100 nm; however, 99mTc-rhenium sulfide showed that more than 21\% were smaller than 100 nm. These radioactive colloids were used with seven different membrane compositions and found not to adsorb significantly to any of them. Conclusion: MF was validated as a simple and reliable technique to estimate the percentage radioactive particle size distribution.},

In this paper we report that covalently coupling the LAAA tin-chlorin e6 to a gold nanoparticle via glutathione results in a potent antimicrobial agent when activated by white light. On a molar basis, the tin chlorin e6-nanogold conjugate was a hundred times more effective at killing Staphylococcus aureus than free tin chlorin e6. The conjugate also displayed antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. This potent new LAAA may be useful for the treatment of topical infections or could be incorporated into coatings that could be used to reduce the microbial load in sensitive environments such as hospitals and food processing facilities.},

	abstract = {Fusion of microcapsules of the polyelectrolytes poly-diallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDADMAC) and sodium poly-styrenesulfonic acid (PSS) is achieved during the evaporation of NaCl solution in open chambers. The increasingly concentrated salt solution induces a series of faster and accumulating effects in the structure of the membranes and the cores of microcapsules. It creates defects in the membranes, decreases the electrostatic repulsion of polyelectrolytes in the membranes, causes a conformational change of the polyelectrolytes, increases the osmotic pressure gradient across the microcapsule membranes, and decreases the supporting force of the core by sucking water outwards. Due to the surface tension of the microcapsules and the hydrophobic interaction of the polyelectrolytes, microcapsules decrease the surface area and finally fuse. During fusion, their shapes change from peanut to oblate and then finally to round spheres. The neutral polymer molecules in the core diffuse and mix but do not leak out. The polyelectrolytes in the membranes do not mix due to the molecular entanglement. The work on fusion with salt as a critical parameter is important to approach promising artificial micro-containers, whose novel functions arise from the mixing of the inner content.},

It has the advantages of precise control over the size, shape, composition, wall thickness and functions of the obtained hollow microcapsules. More recently, the technique has been developed fast from the fabrication and basic property investigation to functionalization and applications, in particular in bio-related fields such as controlled drug delivery, biosensors and bioreactors. In this article, we shall review recent advances in property manipulation of electrostatic and hydrogen bonded microcapsules by chemical crosslinking, and microcapsules assembled by other driving forces such as covalent interaction, base pair interaction, host-guest interaction and van der Waals interaction. Then the possible applications of LbL microcapsules in bio-related fields are summarized with particular emphasis on very recent achievements in terms of loading and release, surface modification for stealth function or targeting and use as biosensors and bioreactors.},

Following light absorption, the NQD activates a molecular catalyst adsorbed on the surface of the NQD via transfer of one or more charges (either electrons or electron-holes) from the NQD to the molecular catalyst. The activated molecular catalyst can then drive a chemical reaction. A photoelectrolytic device that includes such photocatalytic materials is also described.},

The nanopores, used in the work presented here, were prepared using the track-etch process. The fabrication of track-etched conical nanopores has been optimized to allow for single nanopores with reproducible dimensions to be prepared. We have also demonstrated techniques that allow for easy and controllable manipulation of nanopore geometry (e.g., cone angle). We will consider the ion transport properties of the conical nanopores and factors that affect these properties. Methods for introducing functions that mimic biological ion channels, such as voltage-gating, into these nanopores will also be addressed. Three prototype sensors developed from single conical nanopores will be presented. In the first two sensors, the single conical nanopores function as resistive-pulse sensors and detect the presence of analytes as current-blockade events in the ion current. The third sensor functions in an on/off mode, much like a ligand-gated ion channel. In the presence of a target analyte, the ion current permanently shuts off.},

The nanoparticles also showed high saturation magnetization of about 80−83 emu/g at low temperature, almost size-independent and close to the value for the bulk counterpart. Decanoic acid-coated nanoparticles were transferred to water by using tetramethylammonium hydroxide, which allowed further coating with silica in a tetraethyl orthosilicate solution. Consequently, these iron oxide nanoparticles are tunable in size and highly magnetic, and they could become suitable candidates for various biomedical applications such as contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic carriers for drug delivery.},

The Coulter counting principle has been used to determine the size, concentration, and in favorable cases the surface charge, of nanometer-scale colloidal particles, viruses, DNA and other polymers, and metal ions. A resurgence of interest in the field of Coulter counting is occurring because of the advent of new technologies that permit fabrication of membranes containing single, robust, and chemically well-defined channels having smaller and more uniform sizes than could be prepared in the past. These channels are prepared from biological materials, such as self-assembling membrane proteins, and from synthetic materials such as polymers, carbon nanotubes, and silicon-based inorganic materials. In addition to particle characterization, there have been a few recent examples of using Coulter counters to study chemical processes, such as the dehybridization of DNA.},

	abstract = {Recent studies suggest that epigenetic regulation (heritable changes in gene expression that occur in the absence of alterations in DNA sequences) may in part mediate the complex gene-by-environment interactions that can lead to asthma. The variable natural history of asthma (i.e., incidence and remission of symptoms) may be a result of epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, covalent histone modifications, microRNA changes, and chromatin alterations, after early or later environmental exposures. Findings from multiple epidemiologic and experimental studies indicate that asthma risk may be modified by epigenetic regulation. One study suggested that the transmission of asthma risk may occur across multiple generations. Experimental studies provide substantial in vitro data indicating that DNA methylation of genes critical to T-helper cell differentiation may induce polarization toward or away from an allergic phenotype. Despite this initial progress, fundamental questions remain that need to be addressed by well-designed research studies. Data generated from controlled experiments using in vivo models and/or clinical specimens collected after environmental exposure monitoring are limited. Importantly, cohort-driven epigenetic research has the potential to address key questions, such as those concerning the influence of timing of exposure, dose of exposure, diet, and ethnicity on susceptibility to asthma development. There is immense promise that the study of environmental epigenetics will help us understand a theoretically preventable environmental disease.},

	title = {Influence of spacer length on heparin coupling efficiency and fibrinogen adsorption of modified titanium surfaces},
	volume = {6},
	url = {http://www.biomedical-engineering-online.com/content/6/1/31},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Chemical bonding of the drug onto surfaces by means of spacer molecules is accompanied with a reduction of the biological activity of the drug due to a constricted mobility since normally only short spacer molecule like aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APMS) are used for drug coupling. This work aimed to study covalent attachment of heparin to titanium(oxide) surfaces by varying the length of the silane coupling agent, which should affect the biological potency of the drug due to a higher mobility with longer spacer chains.METHODS:Covalent attachment of heparin to titanium metal and TiO2 powder was carried out using the coupling agents 3-(Trimethoxysilyl)-propylamine (APMS), N- [3-(Trimethoxysilyl)propyl]ethylenediamine (Diamino-APMS) and N1- [3-(Trimethoxy-silyl)-propyl]diethylenetriamine (Triamino-APMS). The amount of bound coupling agent and heparin was quantified photometrically by the ninhydrin reaction and the tolidine-blue test. The biological potency of heparin was determined photometrically by the chromogenic substrate Chromozym TH and fibrinogen adsorption to the modified surfaces was researched using the QCM-D (Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation Monitoring) technique.RESULTS:Zeta-potential measurements confirmed the successful coupling reaction; the potential of the unmodified anatase surface (approx. -26 mV) shifted into the positive range ({\textgreater} + 40 mV) after silanisation. Binding of heparin results in a strongly negatively charged surface with zeta-potentials of approx. -39 mV. The retaining biological activity of heparin was highest for the spacer molecule Triamino-APMS. QCM-D measurements showed a lower viscosity for adsorbed fibrinogen films on heparinised surfaces by means of Triamino-APMS.CONCLUSION:The remaining activity of heparin was found to be highest for the covalent attachment with Triamino-APMS as coupling agent due to the long chain of this spacer molecule and therefore the highest mobility of the drug. Furthermore, the adsorption of fibrinogen on the differently heparinised surfaces in real time demonstrated that with longer spacer chains the DeltaD/Deltaf ratios became higher, which is also associated with better biocompatible properties of the substrates in contact with a biosystem.},

However, the rapidly growing number of publications in this field suggests that microwave chemistry will play an outstanding role in the broad field of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology. This article is not meant to give an exhaustive overview of all nanomaterials synthesized by the microwave technique, but to discuss the new opportunities that arise as a result of the unique features of microwave chemistry. Principles, advantages and limitations of microwave chemistry are introduced, its application in the synthesis of different classes of functional nanomaterials is discussed, and finally expected benefits for nanomaterials' synthesis are elaborated.},

A well-defined flow of colloids toward the surface is realized using a radial impinging jet cell geometry. The saturation coverage after prolonged deposition can be analyzed in terms of random sequential adsorption and depends on the ionic strength of the solution, in good agreement with DLVO theory. Atomic force microscopy measurements indicate that for higher coverages, the formation of particle clusters gives rise to a deviation from DLVO behavior. After a short transition time, the dynamics of the deposition process is at first mass transport limited. Surface blocking effects determine the adsorption kinetics in the final stage. The entire deposition process can be adequately described in terms of a generalized adsorption theory, which combines the effects of mass transport and the actual adsorption onto the surface.},

	abstract = {The deposition of charge-stabilized colloidal gold nanocrystals on silicon substrates, derivatized with (aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES), is studied using atomic force microscopy. The influence of ionic strength on the spatial distribution of gold nanocrystal assemblies is analyzed in terms of radial distribution functions. The minimum interparticle distance for these deposited particles with diameters in the low-nanometer range is shown to be tunable by varying the ionic strength of the solution from which the particles are deposited. The results are in line with previous work on considerably larger particles. Furthermore, because of the strong electrostatic interaction between the citrate-covered nanocrystals and the APTES-derivatized substrate surface, the sticking coefficient is one, while the surface mobility is negligible. In agreement with this, the results can be described perfectly in terms of the random sequential adsorption model for “soft” particles.},

	abstract = {Photoresponsive surfaces were prepared by attaching pyrimidine-terminated molecules to flat gold substrates (as thiol self-assembled monolayers) or by dip-coating quartz surfaces. Both types of films underwent photodimerization (two pyrimidine rings react with one another and form a cyclobutane type dimer through the C5═C6 double bond) when irradiated with light of 280 nm wavelength. The reverse reaction was carried out by irradiating the dimerized surface with light of 240 nm wavelength. The photoinduced chemical changes are accompanied by a change in the physical properties of the surface (e.g., wettability and acidity), and are highly dependent on the structure of the photoactive molecules. The surface dimerization reaction follows a pseudo-first order reaction. The rate constant is determined by the structure of the pyrimidine headgroup. In self-assembled monolayers, uracil derivatives dimerize faster than thymine derivatives due to a reduced steric repulsion near the reaction center. In dip-coated films, however, uracil derivatives appear to be less ordered and, correspondingly, the efficiency of the reaction is lower. The reaction rate is also very sensitive to the ordering within the layer, which can be manipulated through the structure of the tail. In SAMs, faster dimerization occurs with molecules containing flexible chains. In dip-coated films, the presence of a polar group at the chain terminus favors dimerization.},

By using the newly developed successive ion layer adhesion and reaction (SILAR) technique, we could gradually change the shell composition from CdS to ZnS in the radial direction. Because of the stepwise adjustment of the lattice parameters in the radial direction, the resulting nanocrystals show a high crystallinity and are almost perfectly spherical, as was investigated by X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy. Also, due to the radial increase of the respective valence- and conduction-band offsets, the nanocrystals are well electronically passivated. This leads to a high fluorescence quantum yield of 70−85\% for the amine terminated multishell particles in organic solvents and a quantum yield of up to 50\% for mercapto propionic acid-covered particles in water. Finally, we present experimental results that substantiate the superior photochemical and colloidal stability of the multishell particles.},

By combining simultaneous cyclic voltammetry and confocal microscopy it is demonstrated that when a positive potential is applied to the film in an acetonitrile electrolyte, the PL is irreversibly quenched. This is irrespective of whether the samples are under an inert atmosphere or exposed to air or water vapor. When a negative potential is applied under nitrogen, quenching is also observed; however, it is reversible. Conversely when a negative potential is applied to the NC films in aerated acetonitrile, the PL intensity increases. The enhancement of the PL is stable for at least 180 s while the potential is held at −1.0 V (vs Ag quasi-reference electrode). When the potential is removed the PL intensity returns to the starting value. These results clearly indicate that photobrightening and charge carrier injection are coupled processes. On the basis of these data, we propose a simple kinetic model that explains the origins of photobrightening.},

	abstract = {Successive ion layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) originally developed for the deposition of thin films on solid substrates from solution baths is introduced as a technique for the growth of high-quality core/shell nanocrystals of compound semiconductors. The growth of the shell was designed to grow one monolayer at a time by alternating injections of air-stable and inexpensive cationic and anionic precursors into the reaction mixture with core nanocrystals. The principles of SILAR were demonstrated by the CdSe/CdS core/shell model system using its shell-thickness-dependent optical spectra as the probes with CdO and elemental S as the precursors. For this reaction system, a relatively high temperature, about 220−240 °C, was found to be essential for SILAR to fully occur. The synthesis can be readily performed on a multigram scale. The size distribution of the core/shell nanocrystals was maintained even after five monolayers of CdS shell (equivalent to about 10 times volume increase for a 3.5 nm CdSe nanocrystal) were grown onto the core nanocrystals. The epitaxial growth of the core/shell structures was verified by optical spectroscopy, TEM, XRD, and XPS. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PL QY) of the as-prepared CdSe/CdS core/shell nanocrystals ranged from 20\% to 40\%, and the PL full-width at half-maximum (fwhm) was maintained between 23 and 26 nm, even for those nanocrystals for which the UV−vis and PL peaks red-shifted by about 50 nm from that of the core nanocrystals. Several types of brightening phenomena were observed, some of which can further boost the PL QY of the core/shell nanocrystals. The CdSe/CdS core/shell nanocrystals were found to be superior in comparison to the highly luminescent CdSe plain core nanocrystals. The SILAR technique reported here can also be used for the growth of complex colloidal semiconductor nanostructures, such as quantum shells and colloidal quantum wells.},

Introducing the middle shell (CdS or ZnSe) sandwiched between CdSe core and ZnS outer shell allows considerable reducing strain inside nanocrystals because CdS and ZnSe have the lattice parameter intermediate to those of CdSe and ZnS. In contrast to CdSe/ZnS core−shells, in the core−shell−shell nanocrystals ZnS shell grows nearly defect free. Due to high quality of the ZnS shell, the core−shell−shell nanocrystals exhibit PL efficiency and photostability exceeding those of CdSe/ZnS nanocrystals.

	abstract = {III−V semiconductor quantum dots are of considerable interest as their applications cover a broad spectrum, from optoelectronic to biomedical technology. For them to be of practical value, there is a need for a method that provides rapid and scalable production of highly monodispersed nanoparticles. This paper reports an efficient and rapid method of producing highly monodispersed InP quantum dots using a novel precursor-based colloidal synthesis in a noncoordinating solvent. The method also allows judicious control over the size of the quantum dots and can also be extended to produce other III−V quantum dots. In this paper, the synthesis and characterization of highly monodispersed InP quantum dots from newly prepared indium(III) carboxylate complexes in octadecene are detailed. When using indium(III) carboxylate as the indium precursor, no surfactant or coordinating solvents are required to prepare high-quality InP quantum dots in octadecene. The in situ formation of a surfactant upon injection of the phosphine precursor [P(SiMe3)3] helps control the growth of the resulting quantum dots. Structural and optical studies (continuous wave and time-resolved) have been performed on the as-prepared InP quantum dots. In addition, time-resolved photoluminescence has been conducted on etched InP quantum dots. The effects of the carboxylate chain length in indium(III) carboxylate and injection temperature on the growth and properties of quantum dots have been studied.},

	abstract = {Fermi's golden rule is used to formulate rate expressions for charge transfer of delocalized carriers in a nondegenerately doped semiconducting electrode to localized, outer-sphere redox acceptors in an electrolyte phase. If the charge-transfer rate constant is known experimentally, these rate expressions allow computation of the value of the electronic coupling matrix element between the semiconducting electrode and the redox species. This treatment also facilitates comparison between charge-transfer kinetic data at metallic and semiconducting electrodes in terms of parameters such as the electronic coupling to the electrode, the attenuation of coupling with distance into the electrolyte, and the reorganization energy of the charge-transfer event. Within this framework, rate constant values expected at representative semiconducting electrodes have been evaluated from experimental data for charge transfer from Au electrodes to ferrocene-terminated thiols, to Ru(NH3)53+/2+-terminated thiols, and through blocking layers to dissolved [Fe(2,2`-bipyridine)2(CN)2]+/0. Based on the experimental parameters determined for these systems, the maximum rate constant (i.e. at optimal exoergicity) for outer-sphere processes at semiconducting electrodes is computed to be in the range 10-1710-16 cm4 s-1. These values are in excellent agreement with prior theoretical models and experimental results for charge-transfer kinetics at semiconductor/liquid interfaces and thus serve to unify the theoretical and experimental descriptions of electrochemical processes at semiconducting and metallic electrodes.},

The ferrocene group was positioned a fixed distance from the gold surface by the self-assembly of a mixed thiol monolayer of ([eegr]5C5H5)Fe([eegr]5C5H4)CO2(CH2)16SH and CH3(CH2)15SH.

These systems have been used to probe the influence of the electrode density of states on the rate of electron transfer across the electrode/monolayer interface. Monolayers on each material exhibit well-defined voltammetry for the Os2+/3+ redox reaction where the supporting electrolyte is aqueous 1.0 M NaClO4. The high scan rate ({\textgreater}2000 V s-1) voltammetric response has been modeled using a nonadiabatic electron-transfer model. The standard heterogeneous electron-transfer rate constant, k°, depends on the identity of the electrode material, e.g., k° is 6 × 104 and 4 × 103 s-1 for platinum and carbon electrodes, respectively. Chronoamperometry, conducted on a microsecond time scale, has been used to probe the potential dependence of the heterogeneous electron-transfer rate constant. These values range from (4.0 ± 0.2) × 104 to (3.0 ± 0.3) × 103 s-1 on going from platinum to carbon electrodes. Temperature-resolved chronoamperometry and cyclic voltammetry reveal that the electrochemical activation enthalpy, ΔH⧧, and the reaction entropy, ΔSRC⧧, are both independent of the electrode material having values of 11.1 ± 0.5 kJ mol-1 and 29.6 ± 2.4 J mol-1 K-1, respectively. The effect of electrode material on the preexponential factors is discussed in terms of the electrode density of states. These experimental data indicate that the heterogeneous electron-transfer rate for a nonadiabatic process is not simply proportional to the density of states but is modulated by the electronic coupling efficiency. Moreover, the matrix coupling elements, HAB, are between 0.1 and 0.5 J mol-1, which is approximately 4 orders of magnitude smaller than those found from studies of intervalence charge-transfer intensities within comparable dimeric complexes.},

We present a model of carrier trapping that is based on Marcus’ electron-transfer theory and use it to accurately reproduce PL dynamics over a wide temperature range in five core−shell CdSe/CdZnS nanocrystal samples. The resulting pictures of carrier dynamics are then used to identify features in the PL data that may be used in subsequent experiments to reveal information about the energy and distribution of surface-localized trap states. We find that in certain cases, the shape of the ensemble distribution of trap energies can be accurately determined from data recorded at a single temperature that is easily identified from plots of average PL lifetime.},

The quenching ability of organic molecules is greatly influenced not only by their valency and redox potential but also by a type of capping ligand and the particle size of the CdTe nanoparticles. These effects are systematically studied through the fluorescence intensity and its lifetime changes based on photoinduced electron transfer reactions. The results suggest the existence of two different quenching mechanisms: diffusion-mediated electron transfer and electrostatic adsorption of the quenchers, which are both dependent on the valency of the quenchers. Besides conventional reaction schemes such as Rehm−Weller-type photoinduced electron transfer, a new reaction scheme has been successfully introduced by considering multiple adsorption of organic quenchers on a semiconductor nanoparticle. In this scheme, the kinetics of the electron transfer reactions between nanoparticles and quenchers became observable by emission quenching experiments, and they have been studied on the basis of Marcus theory.},

	abstract = {The kinetics and mechanism of fast electron transfer (ET) between tin oxide nanoparticles and electrostatically bound Os(III) and Ru(III) complexes have been examined via transient absorbance spectroscopy. Reaction-order studies establish that, at least in the short time regime, electrons are transferred directly from the tin oxide conduction band, rather than through localized redox trap states. The reactions occur in the high driving force regime (ΔG = −1.1 to −2.3 eV) and span the Marcus normal region, barrierless region, and inverted region. (Inverted reactivity, while commonplace in homogeneous solution-phase reactions, has only rarely been observed in interfacial reactions.) Depending on the reactant, normal or inverted kinetic behavior can also be observed via pH-induced manipulation of the conduction band-edge energy and, therefore, the overall reaction driving force. The observation of kinetically resolved ET over such a wide range of driving forces permits the reorganization energy to be evaluated directly from the maximum of a log(rate constant) versus driving force plot. The value obtained, 1.4 eV, is much larger than expected based on solvent contributions alone. Further analysis of driving force effects suggests that significant, but not dominant, nonclassical contributions (high-frequency vibrational contributions) to the reorganization energy exist. Rate measurements in the barrierless region yield an estimated initial-state/final-state electronic coupling energy, Hab, of 15−30 cm-1, a value consistent with a moderately nonadiabatic ET pathway. Remarkably, even in the inverted region the reactions are thermally activated, with the activation effect evidently being amplified via an entropic driving force effect. Finally, the overall pattern of reactivity stands in remarkable contrast to the pH-independent, trapped-mediated kinetic behavior encountered for closely related metal complexes covalently bound to nanocrystalline TiO2 surfaces.},

	abstract = {Transfer of photoexcited charge from PbS nanocrystals to ligand molecules is investigated in different solvents. We find that the charge transfer rate increases dramatically with solvent dielectric constant. This trend is accounted for by a modified Marcus theory that incorporates only static dielectric effects. The choice of solvent allows significant control of the charge transfer process. As an important example, we find that PbS nanocrystals dispersed in water exhibit charge transfer rates 1000 times higher than the same nanocrystals in organic solvent. Rapid charge extraction will be important to efficient nanocrystal-based photovoltaic and photodetector devices.},

	abstract = {Charge carrier trapping is an important phenomenon in nanocrystal (NC) decay dynamics because it reduces photoluminescence (PL) quantum efficiencies and obscures efforts to understand the interaction of NC excitons with their surroundings. Particularly crucial to our understanding of excitation dynamics in, e.g., multiNC assemblies, would be a way of differentiating between processes involving trap states and those that do not. Direct optical measurement of NC trap state processes is not usually possible because they have negligible transition dipole moments; however, they are known to indirectly affect exciton photoluminescence. Here, we develop a framework, based on Marcus electron transfer theory, to determine NC trap state dynamics from time-resolved NC exciton PL measurements. Our results demonstrate the sensitivity of PL to interfacial dynamics, indicating that the technique can be used as an indirect but effective probe of trap distribution changes. We anticipate that this study represents a step toward understanding how excitons in nanocrystals interact with their surroundings: a quality that must be optimized for their efficient application in photovoltaics, photodetectors, or chemical sensors.},

Structural integrity, microstructural evolution, and corresponding release behaviors of fluorescence dyes and doxorubicin were systematically investigated. Experimental observations showed that the presence of the magnetic nanoparticles in the shell structure allowed the shell structure to evolve from nanocavity development to final rupture of the shell under a given magnetic stimulus of different time durations. Such a microstructural evolution of the magnetic sensitive shell structure explained a corresponding variation of the drug release profile, from relatively slow release to burst-like behavior at different stages of stimulus. It has proposed that the presence of magnetic nanoparticles produced heat, due to magnetic energy dissipation (as Brown and Néel relaxations), and mechanical vibration and motion that induced stress development in the thin shell. Both mechanisms significantly accelerated the relaxation of the shell structure, causing such a microstructural evolution. With such a controllable microstructural evolution of the magnetic-sensitive shell structure, active substances can be well-regulated in a manageable manner with a designable profile according to the time duration under magnetic field. A cell culture study also indicated that the magnetic-sensitive microcapsules allowed a rapid uptake by the A549 cell line, a cancerous cell line, suggesting that the magnetic-sensitive microcapsule with controllable rupturing behavior of the shell offers a potential and effective drug carrier for anticancer applications.},

	abstract = {The scientific community now agrees that the rise in atmospheric CO2, the most abundant green house gas, comes from anthropogenic sources such as the burning of fossil fuels. This atmospheric rise in CO2 results in global climate change. Therefore methods for photochemically transforming CO2 into a source of fuel could offer an attractive way to decrease atmospheric concentrations. One way to accomplish this conversion is through the light-driven reduction of carbon dioxide to methane (CH4(g)) or methanol (CH3OH(l)) with electrons and protons derived from water. Existing infrastructure already supports the delivery of natural gas and liquid fuels, which makes these possible CO2 reduction products particularly appealing. This Account focuses on molecular approaches to photochemical CO2 reduction in homogeneous solution. The reduction of CO2 by one electron to form CO2•− is highly unfavorable, having a formal reduction potential of −2.14 V vs SCE. Rapid reduction requires an overpotential of up to 0.6 V, due at least in part to the kinetic restrictions imposed by the structural difference between linear CO2 and bent CO2•−. An alternative and more favorable pathway is to reduce CO2 though proton-assisted multiple-electron transfer. The development of catalysts, redox mediators, or both that efficiently drive these reactions remains an important and active area of research. We divide these reactions into two class types. In Type I photocatalysis, a molecular light absorber and a transition metal catalyst work in concert. We also consider a special case of Type 1 photocatalysis, where a saturated hydrocarbon links the catalyst and the light absorber in a supramolecular compound. In Type II photocatalysis, the light absorber and the catalyst are the same molecule. In these reactions, transition-metal coordination compounds often serve as catalysts because they can absorb a significant portion of the solar spectrum and can promote activation of small molecules. This Account discusses four classes of transition-metal catalysts: (A) metal tetraaza-macrocyclic compounds; (B) supramolecular complexes; (C) metalloporphyrins and related metallomacrocycles; (D) Re(CO)3(bpy)X-based compounds where bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine. Carbon monoxide and formate are the primary CO2 reduction products, and we also propose bicarbonate/carbonate production. For comprehensiveness, we briefly discuss hydrogen formation, a common side reaction that occurs concurrently with CO2 reduction, though the details of that process are beyond the scope of this Account. It is our hope that drawing attention both to current mechanistic hypotheses and to the areas that are poorly understood will stimulate research that could one day provide an efficient solution to this global problem.},

	abstract = {A promising route to increase the performance of hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) photoelectrodes for solar hydrogen production through water-splitting is to use an extremely thin layer of this visible light absorber on a nanostructured scaffold. However, the typically poor performance of ultrathin (ca. 20�nm) films of hematite has been the limiting factor in implementing this approach. Here, the surprising effect of a substrate pretreatment using tetraethoxysilicate (TEOS) is reported; it results in drastic improvements in the photoperformance of 12.5�nm thick films of hematite. These films exhibit a water oxidation photocurrent onset potential at 1.1�V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) and a plateau current of 0.63�mA cm-2 at 1.5�V vs. RHE under standard illumination conditions, representing the highest reported performance for ultrathin hematite films. In contrast, almost no photoactivity is observed for the photoanode with the same amount of hematite on an untreated substrate. A detailed study of the effects of the TEOS treatment shows that a monolayer of SiOx is formed, which acts to change the hematite nucleation and growth mechanism, increases its crystallinity, reduces the concentration of carrier trapping states of the ultrathin films, and suggests its further application to quantum-dot and extremely-thin-absorber (ETA)-type solar cells.},

	abstract = {The syntheses of soluble windmill and grid porphyrin arrays through the AgI-promoted coupling reaction of 1,4-phenylene-bridged linear porphyrin arrays, which are comprised of a central ZnII beta-free porphyrin and flanking peripheral NiII beta-octaalkylporphyrins, are described. The coupling reaction is advantageous in light of its high regioselectivity occurring only at the meso-position of the ZnII beta-free porphyrin as well as its easy extension to large porphyrin arrays. The windmill porphyrin arrays in turn serve as an effective substrate for further coupling reactions, to give three-dimensionally arranged grid porphyrin arrays. Further the grid porphyrin 12-mer (a tetramer of the linear porphyrin trimer) was also coupled to afford grid porphyrins (24-mer, 36-mer, and 48-mer). These porphyrin arrays were isolated in a discrete form by repetitive GPC/HPLC (GPC=gel-permiation chromatography). Competitive experiments with three linear porphyrin trimers bearing different peripheral metalloporphyrins (ZnII, NiII, and CuII), and the trapping experiment of the radical cation at the peripheral porphyrin with AgNO2, suggested that an initial one-electron oxidation of the easily oxidizable peripheral ZnII beta-octaalkylporphyrin with an AgI ion and a subsequent endothermic hole transfer assist the generation of the radical cation at the central ZnII beta-free porphyrin. In all ZnII-metallated windmill porphyrin arrays, the energy level of the S1 state of the meso-meso-linked diporphyrin core is lower than that of the peripheral porphyrins, thereby allowing an energy flow from the peripheral porphyrins to the central diporphyrin core; this has been confirmed by measurements of fluorescence lifetimes and picosecond time-resolved fluorescence spectra. The excitation energy transfer in the arrays encourages their potential use as an light-harvesting antenna.},

	abstract = {Natural photosynthesis uses sunlight to drive the conversion of energy-poor molecules (H2O, CO2) to energy-rich ones (O2, (CH2O)n). Scientists are working hard to develop efficient artificial photosynthetic systems toward the “Holy Grail” of solar-driven water splitting. High on the list of challenges is the discovery of molecules that efficiently catalyze the reduction of protons to H2. In this Account, we report on one promising class of molecules: cobalt complexes with diglyoxime ligands (cobaloximes). Chemical, electrochemical, and photochemical methods all have been utilized to explore proton reduction catalysis by cobaloxime complexes. Reduction of a CoII-diglyoxime generates a CoI species that reacts with a proton source to produce a CoIII-hydride. Then, in a homolytic pathway, two CoIII-hydrides react in a bimolecular step to eliminate H2. Alternatively, in a heterolytic pathway, protonation of the CoIII-hydride produces H2 and CoIII. A thermodynamic analysis of H2 evolution pathways sheds new light on the barriers and driving forces of the elementary reaction steps involved in proton reduction by CoI-diglyoximes. In combination with experimental results, this analysis shows that the barriers to H2 evolution along the heterolytic pathway are, in most cases, substantially greater than those of the homolytic route. In particular, a formidable barrier is associated with CoIII-diglyoxime formation along the heterolytic pathway. Our investigations of cobaloxime-catalyzed H2 evolution, coupled with the thermodynamic preference for a homolytic route, suggest that the rate-limiting step is associated with formation of the hydride. An efficient water splitting device may require the tethering of catalysts to an electrode surface in a fashion that does not inhibit association of CoIII-hydrides.},

which the mechanism could be switched between concerted and step-wise proton-coupled electron transfer. Moreover, a manganese
dimer linked to a ruthenium complex could be oxidized in three successive steps, from Mn2II,II to Mn2III,IV by the photo-oxidized ruthenium sensitizer. This was possible thanks to a charge compensating ligand exchange in the manganese
complex. Detailed studies of the ligand exchange suggested that at high water concentrations, each oxidation step is coupled
to a proton-release of water-derived ligands, analogous to the oxidation steps of the manganese cluster of Photosystem II.},

The available structural and ν(CO) spectra are closely reproduced by density-functional theory calculations. The calculated structure of 4Fe6S2- closely mirrors that of the diiron subsite of the [Fe−Fe] hydrogenase H cluster with a bridging CO group and an open coordination site on the outer Fe atom of pairs of dithiolate-bridged Fe0FeII subunits connected by two bridging thiolates. Geometry optimization based on the all-terminal CO isomer of 4Fe6S2- does not give a stable structure but reveals a second-order saddle point ca. 11.53 kcal mol-1 higher in energy than the CO-bridged form. Spectroelectrochemical studies of electrocatalytic proton reduction by 4Fe6S show that slow turnover from the primary reduction process (E1/2‘ = −0.71 V vs Ag/AgCl) involves rate-limiting protonation of 4Fe6S- followed by reduction to H:4Fe6S-. Rapid electrocatalytic proton reduction is obtained at potentials sufficient to access 4Fe6S2-, where the rate of dihydrogen elimination from the FeIIFeII core of 4Fe6S is ca. 500 times faster than that from the FeIFeI core of Fe2(μ-S(CH2)3S)(CO)6. The dramatically increased rate of electrocatalysis obtained from 4Fe6S over all previously identified model compounds appears to be related to the features uniquely common between it and the H-cluster, namely, that turnover involves the same formal redox states of the diiron unit (FeIFeII and Fe0FeII), the presence of an open site on the outer Fe atom of the Fe0FeII unit, and the thiolate-bridge to a second one-electron redox unit.},

In solution, the complex is actually protected from decomposition by the presence of oxygen as a result of deactivation of the complex by oxygen quenching before it can undergo ligand loss by monomolecular dissociation; however, in polymers, the presence of oxygen increases photochemical decomposition. Singlet molecular oxygen, a product of the oxygen quenching process, may attack the ground state complex or triplet oxygen may directly attack the excited state of the complex. Both mechanisms may be involved in the photodestruction of the complex. The role of oxygen in the photodecomposition was examined by monitoring the photochemical decomposition of various complexes of different singlet oxygen reactivity, as well as absorption and mass spectroscopy studies. It is suggested that in polymers, unlike in solutions, the newly formed reactive singlet oxygen is not able to diffuse away from the complex. The singlet oxygen, trapped in close proximity to the metal complex, has an enhanced opportunity to attack it. This cage effect is supported by studies using tris(1,10-phenanthroline)ruthenium(II) in poly(ethylene glycol) of increasing molecular weight to create an increasingly constraining cage around the complex. Increased poly(ethylene glycol) molecular weight leads to increased oxygen attack of the complex, supporting the cage effect.},

Synthetic diiron complexes as functional models of the [FeFe] hydrogenase H2ase enzyme active site have moved into the centre of focus as potentially viable catalysts for the reductive side of this process, i.e. the reduction of protons to molecular hydrogen. The active site of the enzyme, as well as its mimics in an artificial system, are required to accumulate two electrons from single electron transfer events and to combine them with two protons to form hydrogen. Whereas in biology this reaction is not coupled to photosynthesis and thus proceeds in the dark, additional aspects need to be considered when designing a functional artificial system for the light-driven reduction of protons. Suitable photosensitizers have to be chosen that not only provide sufficient driving force for the reduction of the synthetic diiron catalyst, but also allow for selective excitation to minimize photodegradation. Electron transfer efficiencies have to be optimized for all steps and the sequential nature of the catalyst reduction requires a sufficient stability of potentially labile intermediates of the catalytic cycle.In this perspective, systems for the light-driven conversion of protons to molecular hydrogen are discussed where the catalyst is based on model complexes of the [FeFe] H2ase active site. Covalently linked dyads, supramolecular assemblies and multi-component systems will be examined with an emphasis on mechanistic electron transfer schemes, the properties of the individual components, their scope and their potential limitations.},

All successful reactions of 2 afford the binuclear WVI/CuI products [WO(bdt)(μ2-S)2Cu(L)]2−/− with L = carbene (3), Ar*S (4), Ar* (7), SSiR3 (R = Ph (5), Pri (6)). Similarly, [W(bdt)(OSiPh3)S2]− leads to [W(bdt)(OSiPh3)(μ2-S)2Cu(SAr*)]− (8). These complexes, with apical oxo and basal dithiolato and sulfido coordination (excluding 8), terminal thiolate ligation at CuI (4−6, 8), and W-(μ2-S)-Cu bridging, bear a structural resemblance to the enzyme site. Differences include two bridges instead of one and the absence of basal oxo/hydroxo ligation. Complex 8 differs from the others by utilizing apical and basal sulfido ligands in bridge formation. Related reaction systems based on 1 gave 4 in small yield or product mixtures in which the desired monobridged complex [WO2(bdt)(μ2-S)Cu(R)]2− was not detected. Mass spectrometric analysis of the reaction system with L = carbene suggests that any monobridged species forms may converted to the dibridged form by disproportionation. In these experiments, the use of WVI preserves the structural integrity of MoVI, whose analogues of 1 and 2 have not been isolated.

	abstract = {Mastering the production of solar fuels by artificial photosynthesis would be a considerable feat, either by water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen or reduction of CO2 to methanol or hydrocarbons: 2H2O + 4hν → O2 + 2H2; 2H2O + CO2 + 8hν → 2O2 + CH4. It is notable that water oxidation to dioxygen is a key half-reaction in both. In principle, these solar fuel reactions can be coupled to light absorption in molecular assemblies, nanostructured arrays, or photoelectrochemical cells (PECs) by a modular approach. The modular approach uses light absorption, electron transfer in excited states, directed long range electron transfer and proton transfer, both driven by free energy gradients, combined with proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) and single electron activation of multielectron catalysis. Until recently, a lack of molecular catalysts, especially for water oxidation, has limited progress in this area. Analysis of water oxidation mechanism for the “blue” Ru dimer cis,cis-[(bpy)2(H2O)RuIIIORuIII(OH2)(bpy)2]4+ (bpy is 2,2′-bipyridine) has opened a new, general approach to single site catalysts both in solution and on electrode surfaces. As a catalyst, the blue dimer is limited by competitive side reactions involving anation, but we have shown that its rate of water oxidation can be greatly enhanced by electron transfer mediators such as Ru(bpy)2(bpz)2+ (bpz is 2,2′-bipyrazine) in solution or Ru(4,4′-((HO)2P(O)CH2)2bpy)2(bpy)2+ on ITO (ITO/Sn) or FTO (SnO2/F) electrodes. In this Account, we describe a general reactivity toward water oxidation in a class of molecules whose properties can be “tuned” systematically by synthetic variations based on mechanistic insight. These molecules catalyze water oxidation driven either electrochemically or by Ce(IV). The first two were in the series Ru(tpy)(bpm)(OH2)2+ and Ru(tpy)(bpz)(OH2)2+ (bpm is 2,2′- bipyrimidine; tpy is 2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine), which undergo hundreds of turnovers without decomposition with Ce(IV) as oxidant. Detailed mechanistic studies and DFT calculations have revealed a stepwise mechanism: initial 2e−/2H+ oxidation, to RuIV═O2+, 1e− oxidation to RuV═O3+, nucleophilic H2O attack to give RuIII−OOH2+, further oxidation to RuIV(O2)2+, and, finally, oxygen loss, which is in competition with further oxidation of RuIV(O2)2+ to RuV(O2)3+, which loses O2 rapidly. An extended family of 10−15 catalysts based on Mebimpy (Mebimpy is 2,6-bis(1-methylbenzimidazol-2-yl)pyridine), tpy, and heterocyclic carbene ligands all appear to share a common mechanism. The osmium complex Os(tpy)(bpy)(OH2)2+ also functions as a water oxidation catalyst. Mechanistic experiments have revealed additional pathways for water oxidation one involving Cl− catalysis and another, rate enhancement of O—O bond formation by concerted atom−proton transfer (APT). Surface-bound [(4,4′-((HO)2P(O)CH2)2bpy)2RuII(bpm)RuII(Mebimpy)(OH2)]4+ and its tpy analog are impressive electrocatalysts for water oxidation, undergoing thousands of turnovers without loss of catalytic activity. These catalysts were designed for use in dye-sensitized solar cell configurations on TiO2 to provide oxidative equivalents by molecular excitation and excited-state electron injection. Transient absorption measurements on TiO2−[(4,4′((HO)2P(O)CH2)2bpy)2RuII(bpm)RuII(Mebimpy)(OH2)]4+, (TiO2−RuII−RuIIOH2) and its tpy analog have provided direct insight into the interfacial and intramolecular electron transfer events that occur following excitation. With added hydroquinone in a PEC configuration, APCE (absorbed-photon-to-current-efficiency) values of 4−5\% are obtained for dehydrogenation of hydroquinone, H2Q + 2hν → Q + H2. In more recent experiments, we are using the same PEC configuration to investigate water splitting.},

The probe molecule, methyl viologen (MV2+) interacts with the excited CdSe nanoparticle and quenches its emission effectively. The ultrafast electron transfer to MV2+, as monitored from the exciton bleaching recovery of CdSe and the formation of MV+• radical, is completed with an average rate constant of 2.25 × 1010 s−1. Under steady state irradiation (450 nm) the accumulation of MV+• is seen with a net quantum yield of 0.1. Mediation of the electron transfer through TiO2 nanoparticles is achieved by coupling them with the CdSe-MV2+ system within the reverse micelle. This coupling of two semiconductor nanoparticles increases the quantum yield of MV2+ reduction by a factor of 2. The dual roles of TiO2 as an electron shuttle and a rectifier are elucidated by transient absorption spectroscopy and steady state photolysis. The presence of both TiO2 and MV2+ in the reverse micelle creates a synergistic effect to enhance the electron transfer rate constant by an order of magnitude. The time-resolved events that dictate the production and stabilization of electron transfer product provide an insight into the photocatalytic systems that are potentially important in solar hydrogen production and photocatalytic remediation.},

	abstract = {In natural photosynthesis, organisms optimize solar energy conversion through organized assemblies of photofunctional chromophores and catalysts within proteins that provide specifically tailored environments for chemical reactions. As with their natural counterparts, artificial photosynthetic systems for practical solar fuels production must collect light energy, separate charge, and transport charge to catalytic sites where multielectron redox processes will occur. While encouraging progress has been made on each aspect of this complex problem, researchers have not yet developed self-ordering and self-assembling components and the tailored environments necessary to realize a fully-functional artificial system. Previously researchers have used complex, covalent molecular systems comprised of chromophores, electron donors, and electron acceptors to mimic both the light-harvesting and the charge separation functions of photosynthetic proteins. These systems allow for study of the dependencies of electron transfer rate constants on donor−acceptor distance and orientation, electronic interaction, and the free energy of the reaction. The most useful and informative systems are those in which structural constraints control both the distance and the orientation between the electron donors and acceptors. Self-assembly provides a facile means for organizing large numbers of molecules into supramolecular structures that can bridge length scales from nanometers to macroscopic dimensions. The resulting structures must provide pathways for migration of light excitation energy among antenna chromophores, and from antennas to reaction centers. They also must incorporate charge conduits, that is, molecular “wires” that can efficiently move electrons and holes between reaction centers and catalytic sites. The central scientific challenge is to develop small, functional building blocks with a minimum number of covalent linkages, which also have the appropriate molecular recognition properties to facilitate self-assembly of complete, functional artificial photosynthetic systems. In this Account, we explore how self-assembly strategies involving π-stacking can be used to integrate light harvesting with charge separation and transport. Our current strategy uses covalent building blocks based on chemically robust arylene imide and diimide dyes, biomimetic porphyrins, and chlorophylls. We take advantage of the shapes, sizes, and intermolecular interactions—such as π−π and/or metal−ligand interactions—of these molecules to direct the formation of supramolecular structures having enhanced energy capture and charge-transport properties. We use small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) from a synchrotron source to elucidate the solution phase structures of these monodisperse noncovalent aggregates. We expect that a greater understanding of self-assembly using π-stacking and molecular designs that combine those features with hydrogen bonding and metal-ligand bonding could simplify the structure of the building blocks for artificial photosynthetic complexes, while retaining their ability to assemble complex, photofunctional structures.},

	abstract = {Photosynthesis in plants and cyanobacteria involves two protein−cofactor complexes which are denoted as photosystems (PS), PSII and PSI. These solar-energy converters have powered life on earth for approximately 3 billion years. They facilitate light-driven carbohydrate formation from H2O and CO2, by oxidizing the former and reducing the latter. PSII splits water in a process driven by light. Because all attractive technologies for fuel production driven by solar energy involve water oxidation, recent interest in this process carried out by PSII has increased. In this Account, we describe and apply a rationale for estimating the solar-energy conversion efficiency (ηSOLAR) of PSII: the fraction of the incident solar energy absorbed by the antenna pigments and eventually stored in form of chemical products. For PSII at high concentrations, approximately 34\% of the incident solar energy is used for creation of the photochemistry-driving excited state, P680*, with an excited-state energy of 1.83 eV. Subsequent electron transfer results in the reduction of a bound quinone (QA) and oxidation of the TyrZ within 1 μs. This radical-pair state is stable against recombination losses for approximately 1 ms. At this level, the maximal ηSOLAR is 23\%. After the essentially irreversible steps of quinone reduction and water oxidation (the final steps catalyzed by the PSII complex), a maximum of 50\% of the excited-state energy is stored in chemical form; ηSOLAR can be as high as 16\%. Extending our considerations to a photosynthetic organism optimized to use PSII and PSI to drive H2 production, the theoretical maximum of the solar-energy conversion efficiency would be as high as 10.5\%, if all electrons and protons derived from water oxidation were used for H2 formation. The above performance figures are impressive, but they represent theoretical maxima and do not account for processes in an intact organism that lower these yields, such as light saturation, photoinhibitory, protective, and repair processes. The overpotential for catalysis of water oxidation at the Mn4Ca complex of PSII may be as low as 0.3 V. To address the specific energetics of water oxidation at the Mn complex of PSII, we propose a new conceptual framework that will facilitate quantitative considerations on the basis of oxidation potentials and pK values. In conclusion, photosynthetic water oxidation works at high efficiency and thus can serve as both an inspiring model and a benchmark in the development of future technologies for production of solar fuels.},

	abstract = {Because sunlight is diffuse and intermittent, substantial use of solar energy to meet humanity’s needs will probably require energy storage in dense, transportable media via chemical bonds. Practical, cost effective technologies for conversion of sunlight directly into useful fuels do not currently exist, and will require new basic science. Photosynthesis provides a blueprint for solar energy storage in fuels. Indeed, all of the fossil-fuel-based energy consumed today derives from sunlight harvested by photosynthetic organisms. Artificial photosynthesis research applies the fundamental scientific principles of the natural process to the design of solar energy conversion systems. These constructs use different materials, and researchers tune them to produce energy efficiently and in forms useful to humans. Fuel production via natural or artificial photosynthesis requires three main components. First, antenna/reaction center complexes absorb sunlight and convert the excitation energy to electrochemical energy (redox equivalents). Then, a water oxidation complex uses this redox potential to catalyze conversion of water to hydrogen ions, electrons stored as reducing equivalents, and oxygen. A second catalytic system uses the reducing equivalents to make fuels such as carbohydrates, lipids, or hydrogen gas. In this Account, we review a few general approaches to artificial photosynthetic fuel production that may be useful for eventually overcoming the energy problem. A variety of research groups have prepared artificial reaction center molecules. These systems contain a chromophore, such as a porphyrin, covalently linked to one or more electron acceptors, such as fullerenes or quinones, and secondary electron donors. Following the excitation of the chromophore, photoinduced electron transfer generates a primary charge-separated state. Electron transfer chains spatially separate the redox equivalents and reduce electronic coupling, slowing recombination of the charge-separated state to the point that catalysts can use the stored energy for fuel production. Antenna systems, employing a variety of chromophores that absorb light throughout the visible spectrum, have been coupled to artificial reaction centers and have incorporated control and photoprotective processes borrowed from photosynthesis. Thus far, researchers have not discovered practical solar-driven catalysts for water oxidation and fuel production that are robust and use earth-abundant elements, but they have developed artificial systems that use sunlight to produce fuel in the laboratory. For example, artificial reaction centers, where electrons are injected from a dye molecule into the conduction band of nanoparticulate titanium dioxide on a transparent electrode, coupled to catalysts, such as platinum or hydrogenase enzymes, can produce hydrogen gas. Oxidizing equivalents from such reaction centers can be coupled to iridium oxide nanoparticles, which can oxidize water. This system uses sunlight to split water to oxygen and hydrogen fuel, but efficiencies are low and an external electrical potential is required. Although attempts at artificial photosynthesis fall short of the efficiencies necessary for practical application, they illustrate that solar fuel production inspired by natural photosynthesis is achievable in the laboratory. More research will be needed to identify the most promising artificial photosynthetic systems and realize their potential.},

	abstract = {The importance of photosynthesis has driven researchers to seek ways to mimic its fundamental features in simplified systems. The absorption of a photon by light-harvesting (antenna) complexes made up of a large number of protein-embedded pigments initiates photosynthesis. Subsequently the many pigments within the antenna system shuttle that photon via an efficient excitation energy transfer (EET) until it encounters a reaction center. Since the 1995 discovery of the circularly arranged chromophoric assemblies in the crystal structure of light-harvesting antenna complex LH2 of purple bacteria Rps. Acidophila, many designs of light-harvesting antenna systems have focused on cyclic porphyrin wheels that allow for efficient EET. In this Account, we review recent research in our laboratories in the synthesis of covalently and noncovalently linked discrete cyclic porphyrin arrays as models of the photosynthetic light-harvesting antenna complexes. On the basis of the silver(I)-promoted oxidative coupling strategy, we have prepared a series of extremely long yet discrete meso−meso-linked porphyrin arrays and covalently linked large porphyrin rings. We examined the photophysical properties of these molecules using steady-state absorption, fluorescence, fluorescence lifetime, fluorescence anisotropy decay, and transient absorption measurements. Both the pump-power dependence on the femtosecond transient absorption and the transient absorption anisotropy decay profiles are directly related to the EET processes within the porphyrin rings. Within these structures, the exciton−exciton annihilation time and the polarization anisotropy rise time are well-described in terms of the Förster-type incoherent energy hopping model. In noncoordinating solvents such as CHCl3, meso-pyridine-appended zinc(II) porphyrins and their meso−meso-linked dimers spontaneously assemble to form tetrameric porphyrin squares and porphyrin boxes, respectively. In the latter case, we have demonstrated the rigorous homochiral self-sorting process and efficient EET along these cyclic porphyrin arrays. The meso-cinchomeronimide appended zinc(II) porphyrin forms a cyclic trimer. We have also shown that the corresponding meso−meso-linked diporphyrins undergo high-fidelity self-sorting assembling to form discrete cyclic trimer, tetramer, and pentamer with large association constants through perfect discrimination of enantiomeric and conformational differences of the meso-cinchomeronimide substituents. Collectively, these studies of covalently and noncovalently linked discrete cyclic porphyrin arrays aid in the understanding of the structural requirements for such very fast EET in natural light-harvesting complexes.},

Upon light irradiation, fluorescence quenching by electron transfer was observed from the singlet excited state of the porphyrin to the diiron center, and the mechanism was verified by fluorescence lifetime and transient absorption spectroscopic measurements. In contrast to molecular dyads linked by covalent bonds, the assembled system was designed to avoid charge recombination via complex dissociation after photo-induced electron transfer. Visible light-driven hydrogen generation was observed from this self-assembled system. The assembling strategy employed in this study has the potential to be used for any other hydrogenase models in the future.},

	abstract = {The protonation behavior of the iron hydrogenase active-site mimic [Fe2(mu-adt)(CO)4(PMe3)2] (1; adt=N-benzyl-azadithiolate) has been investigated by spectroscopic, electrochemical, and computational methods. The combination of an adt bridge and electron-donating phosphine ligands allows protonation of either the adt nitrogen to give [Fe2(mu-Hadt)(CO)4(PMe3)2]+ ([1�H]+), the Fe\&bond;Fe bond to give [Fe2(mu-adt)(mu-H)(CO)4(PMe3)2]+ ([1�Hy]+), or both sites simultaneously to give [Fe2(mu-Hadt)(mu-H)(CO)4(PMe3)2]2+ ([1�HHy]2+). Complex 1 and its protonation products have been characterized in acetonitrile solution by IR, 1H, and 31P�NMR spectroscopy. The solution structures of all protonation states feature a basal/basal orientation of the phosphine ligands, which contrasts with the basal/apical structure of 1 in the solid state. Density functional calculations have been performed on all protonation states and a comparison between calculated and experimental spectra confirms the structural assignments. The ligand protonated complex [1�H]+ (pKa=12) is the initial, metastable protonation product while the hydride [1�Hy]+ (pKa=15) is the thermodynamically stable singly protonated form. Tautomerization of cation [1�H]+ to [1�Hy]+ does not occur spontaneously. However, it can be catalyzed by HCl (k=2.2�m-1�s-1), which results in the selective formation of cation [1�Hy]+. The protonations of the two basic sites have strong mutual effects on their basicities such that the hydride (pKa=8) and the ammonium proton (pKa=5) of the doubly protonated cationic complex [1�HHy]2+ are considerably more acidic than in the singly protonated analogues. The formation of dication [1�HHy]2+ from cation [1�H]+ is exceptionally slow with perchloric or trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (k=0.15�m-1�s-1), while the dication is formed substantially faster (k\&gt;102�m-1�s-1) with hydrobromic acid. Electrochemically, 1 undergoes irreversible reduction at -2.2�V versus ferrocene, and this potential shifts to -1.6, -1.1, and -1.0�V for the cationic complexes [1�H]+, [1�Hy]+, and [1�HHy]2+, respectively, upon protonation. The doubly protonated form [1�HHy]2+ is reduced at less negative potential than all previously reported hydrogenase models, although catalytic proton reduction at this potential is characterized by slow turnover.},

level. The cancer cells expressing HER2 protein were visualized by the nanoparticles in vivo at subcellular resolution, suggesting
future utilization of the system in medical applications to improve drug-delivery systems to target the primary and metastatic
tumors for made-to-order treatment. We also describe sentinel node navigation using fluorescent nanoparticles for breast cancer
surgery in experimental model, which have shown the potential to be an alternative to existing tracers in the detection of
the sentinel node if we select the appropriate particle size and wavelength. Future innovation in cancer imaging by nanotechnology

This has been rationalized by means of NMR studies that can be explained by calculations using density functional theory (DFT) methods. Thus, if one reacts such solutions with transition-metal ions, quaternary M/Sn/E1/E2 anions are obtained, which exhibit coordination by different ternary chalcogenidostannate ligands. The electronic excitation energies of the corresponding alkali metal salts lie between the Eg values of compounds containing either M/Sn/E1 or M/Sn/E2 anions. In this way, we provide a simple approach toward a library of semiconductor compounds with finely-tuned optoelectronic properties.},

to trace the future trends taking into account their potentialities and the different economical constraints. During these
last 20 years solvothermal reactions have been mainly used from preparing micro- or nanoparticles with different morphologies.
Due to the importance to dispose of new materials for developing either basic research or industrial applications, such a
presentation will be only focussed on the potentialities of solvothermal reactions in materials synthesis. Solvothermal reactions
are mainly characterized by different chemical parameters (nature of the reagents and of the solvent) and thermodynamical
parameters (in particular temperature, pressure). (a) The selection of the composition of the solvent opens new research areas
for stabilizing materials belonging to different classes of materials (alloys, oxides, nitrides, sulphides…). (b) The mild
temperature conditions generally used are able to improve chemical diffusion and reactivity in order to help the preparation
of specific materials at the frontier between either different classes of inorganic materials (oxides-nitrides, nitrides-halides…)
or inorganic/organic, inorganic/biologic frameworks. (c) The high pressure conditions, due to the small conveyed energy compared
to temperature, allow also to stabilize metastable frontier materials (geo-inspired or bio-inspired materials). (d) In the
future, taking into account, from one side: the economical and the environmental constraints, and from the other: the industrial
demand of materials characterized by specific physical, chemical and biological properties, the potential developments of
solvothermal processes will be analyzed.},

The particle size increased with increasing reaction time, temperature, stabilizer concentration, and Cd/Se ratio. The mean size decreased with increasing pH.

The silica nanoparticles remain stable in ethanol within a wide temperature range of 24304 oC at 12.3 MPa, and they start to aggregate at T 305 oC. Numerical analysis reveals that the net interparticle repulsive potential barrier decreases dramatically with increasing temperature due to the changes in the properties of the medium. We observed that particles remain highly stable in the nonpolar supercritical ethanol in the temperature regime 241304 oC, where the DLVO potential barrier is only 52 kBT. The dispersion stability of silica nanoparticles at this low potential barrier in high-temperature and high-pressure ethanol, especially in the supercritical ethanol, is fascinating. The silicaethanol system might be a unique and special example in the colloidal dispersions. Results suggest that silica nanoparticles may be used as a model colloid to investigate the colloidal transport phenomena in the supercritical ethanol.},

	abstract = {The pressure dependence of the colloidal phenomena of nanoparticles in hydrothermal water was investigated by both experiment and theory. Dynamic light scattering experiments show that diamond nanoparticles, which are highly stable in ambient water, easily aggregate in high-temperature and high-pressure water. Although the stability of nanoparticles in ambient pure water does not depend on pressure, it is interestingly found that at constant temperature particles aggregate faster in the hydrothermal regime when the pressure is higher. A theoretical interpretation is proposed to predict the stability of colloids in water as a function of temperature and pressure. Numerical analysis shows that the repulsive interparticle potential barrier, which stabilizes particles in the dispersion, decreases dramatically in high-temperature and high-pressure water. The decrease in the potential barrier arises from the temperature and the pressure dependencies of the dielectric constant (ε) and the ion product (pKw) of water. Numerical analysis shows that the pressure dependence of ε is negligible in the temperature range of 20−300 °C, whereas the pressure dependence of pKw is significant at temperatures of T {\textgreater} 150 °C. The theory reveals that the pressure dependence of the rate of size increment in the hydrothermal regime results from the pressure dependence of pKw. An increase in pressure in the hydrothermal water enhances the ionization of water molecules which reduces the surface potential of the particles. This effect lowers the interparticle repulsive potential barrier, which accelerates aggregation of the particles.},

	abstract = {The bacterium Klebsiella aerogenes produces extracellular particles of cadmium sulfide in the presence of cadmium ions. The photoactivity of these particles has been studied using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Bacterial samples containing these semiconductor particles were irradiated with visible light in the presence of a spin trap, either phenyl-tert-butylnitrone (PBN) or 5,5-dimethyl-l-pyrroline-N-oxid(eD MPO). The results obtained reveal that a number of radicals, both oxygen and carbon based, are generated. Bacterial samples grown in the absence of cadmium ions exhibit weak, irradiation-independent EPR signals. These bacterially produced radicals are quenched when CdS particles are present. The observation of light-induced radicals provides evidence that the bacterial CdS particles are photoactive, behaving in a similar manner to inorganic CdS particles, and therefore could be used to mediate photocatalytic reactions.},

	volume = {143},
	url = {http://mic.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/143/8/2521},
	abstract = {Summary: Klebsiella pneumoniae overcomes cadmium toxicity through the  biotransformation' of cadmium ions into photoactive, nanometre-sized CdS particles deposited on the cell surface. The kinetics of particle formation during batch culture growth was monitored by electron microscopy (EM), energy-dispersive X-ray analysis and electronic absorption spectroscopy (EAS). During the deceleration phase of bacterial growth, the presence of CdS particles on the outer cell wall of K. pneumoniae ([\&ge;] 5 nm in diameter) was detected by EM. The size of these electron-dense particles continued to increase throughout the stationary phase of growth, with some of the particles reaching a diameter {\textgreater}200 nm. The formation of the extracellular CdS particles contributed to around 3-4\% of the total cell biomass. EAS undertaken on these extracellular  bio-CdS' particles suggested that the large  superparticles' observed by EM, e.g. 200 nm, were aggregates of smaller particles termed  Q-particles', {\textasciitilde} 4 nm in diameter. Metal sulfide particles were not formed in batch cultures of K. pneumoniae grown in the presence of lead, zinc, mercury, copper or silver ions. Growth in the presence of lead ions resulted in the formation of extracellular electron-dense particles containing lead but not sulfide or phosphate. Intracellular phosphorus-containing electron-opaque particles were formed during growth in the presence of copper and mercury. Intracellular electron-dense particles were formed in the presence of zinc ions but these did not contain phosphorus. From these results it was thought that metal sulfide formation in K. pneumoniae showed some cadmium-specificity. When cadmium and zinc ions were both added to the growth medium, metal sulfide particles were formed that were predominantly composed of cadmium, e.g. 48.6\% cadmium and 0.04\% zinc. Similarly, when cadmium and lead ions were both present during growth only CdS particles formed. In both cases analysis of the cells by EAS confirmed the presence of CdS only. These observations suggest that the mechanism of CdS formation is unlikely to occur simply through a cadmium-induced release of hydrogen sulfide by the cells into the external environment. If hydrogen sulfide production was the mechanism of sulfide formation then metal sulfide particles containing lead and zinc ions in addition to cadmium ions should have been produced.},

The spectroscopic properties observed suggest that they are similar in size and possess photoactive traits analogous to CdS systems prepared by conventional chemical methods. The optical nature of the bacterial semiconductor particles means that, in principle, they are capable of performing a variety of photoredox reactions. The reactions involving photoelectrochemical indicators such as methyl viologen (MV2+) and methyl orange (MO-) are considered and, by comparing initial rates of reaction and altering reaction variables, a general mechanism of photoactivity for the cadmium sulfide bio-semiconductor is proposed.},

Their many advantages include membrane permeability, relatively small size, stoichiometric labeling, high affinity, and an assortment of excitation/emission wavelengths. The goal of the current study was to determine whether the biarsenical labeling scheme could be extended to fluorescent detection of analytes in capillary electrophoresis. Recombinant protein or synthesized peptides containing the optimized tetracysteine motif “−C−C−P−G−C−C−” were labeled with biarsenical dyes and then analyzed by micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography (MEKC). The biarsenical−tetracysteine complex was stable and remained fluorescent under standard MEKC conditions for peptide and protein separations. The detection limit following electrophoresis in a capillary was less than 3 × 10−20 mol with a simple laser-induced fluorescence system. A mixture of multiple biarsenical-labeled peptides and a protein were easily resolved. Demonstrating that the label did not interfere with bioactivity, a peptide-based enzyme substrate conjugated to the tetracysteine motif and labeled with a biarsenical dye retained its ability to be phosphorylated by the parent kinase. The feasibility of using this label for chemical cytometry experiments was shown by intracellular labeling and subsequent analysis of a recombinant protein possessing the tetracysteine motif expressed in living cells. The extension of the biarsenical−tetracysteine tag to fluorescent labeling of peptides and proteins in chemical separations is a valuable addition to biochemical and cell-based investigations.},

Antimicrobial results show that these nanocomposite systems display a very effective bactericidal activity toward both Gram+ and Gram− bacteria. However, the hydrogel does not show any cytotoxic effect toward three different eukaryotic cell lines. This is due to the fact that the nanoparticles, immobilized in the gel matrix, can exert their antimicrobial activity by simple contact with the bacterial membrane, while they can not be uptaken and internalized by eukaryotic cells. This novel finding could advantageously contribute to responding to the growing concerns on the toxicity of nanoparticles and facilitate the use of silver−biopolymer composites in the preparation of biomaterials.},

	volume = {38},
	abstract = {Because of their antibacterial properties, silver nanoparticles are often used in consumer products. To assess environmental and/or human health risks from these nanoparticles, there is a need to identify the chemical transformations chat silver nanoparticles undergo in different environments. Thus an antimicrobial sock material containing Ag nanoparticles was examined by X-ray absorption spectroscopy to identify the speciation of Ag. The material was exposed to a hypochlorite/ detergent solution and subjected to agitation. An elemental Ag nanopowder was also exposed to the hypochlorite/detergent solution or to a 1 mol L-1 NaCl solution. Results showed that the sock material nanoparticles consisted of elemental Ag. After exposure to the hypochlorite/detergent Solution, a significant portion (more than 50\%) of the sock nanoparticles were converted, in situ, to AgCl. Results from exposures to elemental Ag nanopowder suggest that an oxidation step is necessary for the elemental Ag nanoparticles to transform into AgCl as there was no evidence of AgCl formation in the presence of chloride alone. As a result, if Ag ions leach from consumer products, any chloride present may quickly scavenge the ions. In addition, the efficacy of Ag, as an antimicrobial agent in fabrics, may be limited, or even negated, after washing in solutions containing oxidizers as AgCl is much less reactive than Ag ion.

	abstract = {Increase in bacterial resistance to most of conventional antibiotics has emerged as one of the most challenging problems for the researcher in the field of biomedical science and engineering. This therefore augers well to look for possible alternative antimicrobial agents that can overcome this resistance. Nanoparticles of metals and semiconductors have great potential as delivery agents in biology and medicine for carrying small molecules such as drugs, proteins, and genes. Metal nanoparticles combined with antibiotics may therefore show improved efficacy in specific treatment, thus lowering side effects associated with drug molecules. In the present study we report use of silver nanoparticles as an active carrier for drug; i.e., chloramphenicol (CHL) in polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). For the first time, it is shown that PVP can play a dual role in such studies wherein it acts as a stabilizing agent as well as a linker for binding the CHL to the silver nanoparticles. CHL-loaded silver nanoparticles showed a characteristic narrow SPR peak at about 410 nm, indicating the spherical nature of the monodispersed particles. The percentage loading of the drug onto the silver nanoparticles was found to be 81\%. The drug-loaded silver nanoparticles showed substantially enhanced activity against clinically isolated S. typhi, thus showing considerable promise for further development. FTIR studies confirmed the binding of CHL to the silver nanoparticles through the -NH group of CHL and free -C = O group of PVP, thus confirming the role of PVP as a linker. The particle size distribution was found to be in the range of 10-15 nm. TEM indicated that the nanoparticles are spherical in shape. The drug-loaded silver nanoparticles were cast into film by using PVA, which showed a broadened XRD pattern, indicative of very small size.},

The morphologies of natural cellulose fibers and silver nanoparticles were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and UV-visible spectroscopy. The content of silver nanoparticles in cellulose fibers was measured by inductive coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-ms). Experimental results revealed that sodium borohydride (NaBH,) played dual effects in the formation of silver nanoparticles. The mean size (d) and size distribution (sigma) of silver nanoparticles could be adjusted by changing the concentration of NaBH4. Monodisperse silver nanoparticles (d = 2.7 nm, sigma = 0.6 nm) in cellulose fibers were successfully prepared under optimized conditions. When the NaBH4 concentration was very low (0.1 mM), a stable colloidal solution (storage stability {\textgreater} 1 month) of silver nanoparticles was produced, which provides a novel, mild approach to the preparation of stable colloidal solutions of metal nanoparticles. The ability of silver nanoparticle-loaced cellulose fibers to prohibit the propagation of Escherichia coli was estimated by the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC). Based on the experimental observations, the antibacterial mode of silver nanoparticle-loaded cellulose fibers was discussed in details.},
