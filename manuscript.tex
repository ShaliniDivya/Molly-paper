\begin{abstract}

In this work, we developed rechargeable AIBs using molybdenum dichalcogenides- MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$ and MoSSe with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder as the cathode. The aluminium ion batteries exhibit clear discharge voltage plateaus in the ranges 1.6-1.4 V for MoS$_{2}$ and MoSe$_{2}$, and 0.6–0.5 V for MoSSe. While the MoSSe cathode exhibits a higher specific capacity over MoS$_2$ and MoSe$_2$ but the overall energy density is lower than MoSe$_2$ at a current density of 40 mA g$^-{^1}$, MoSe$_2$ proves to be a more stable cathode with a discharge specific capacity of 110 mAh g$^-{^1}$ with an average potential at $\approx 2.0 V$. Charge–discharge cycling at 100 mA g$^-{^1}$ demonstrates the stability of Al/MoSe$_2$ cell over 200 cycles with 90 \% coulombic efficiency.

\section{Introduction}
The use of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) has grown significantly in recent years. The high energy density is one of the chief advantages of lithium-ion battery technology. In addition, they do not require any maintenance to ensure their performance. However, lithium-ion cells and batteries are not as robust as some other rechargeable technologies. They require protection from being over charged and discharged too far. After a while, batteries may need replacing due to ageing and this can be an issue if they are embedded in the equipment. Many airlines limit the number of lithium ion batteries they take. Any lithium-ion battery carried separately must be protected against short circuits by protective covers while travelling in air. Lithium-ion’s limitations are obvious, which is why there is a growing interest in finding alternative technologies. Among various batteries, Al-ion batteries (AIBs) have high gravimetric capacity (2,980 Ah kg$^-^1$) of the Al anode when compared to Li$^+$/Li (3,862 Ah kg$^-^1$) and Na$^+$/Na (1,166 Ah kg$^-^1$) resulting from Al$^3^+$/Al redox couple. Aluminium-ion batteries (AIBs) are a promising alternative to meet the growing demands. They are low in cost, recyclable and an ionic liquid used as electrolyte renders non-flammability. Although aluminium (Al) has a higher standard oxidation potential than lithium (Li), Al$^3^+$ cations result in a higher theoretical energy density compared to monovalent lithium (Li$^+$). Vanadium oxides such as V$_2$O$_5$ and VO$_2$ exhibited promising results but the intercalating Al$^3{^+}$ ions fixed themselves between the V$_2$O${_5}$ layers that made their diffusion very slow resulting in fewer charge/discharge cycles. Chiku \textit{et al} \cite{chiku_amorphous_2015} introduced an amorphous V$_2$O${_5}$/carbon composite where presence of highly electro-conductive Ketjenblack weakened the interaction between intercalating Al$^3^+$ ions and amorphous V$_2$O$_5$ layers, significantly improving the battery performance. Using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, the team found that the valency of vanadium changed while charging/discharging the cell. Two-dimensional vanadium carbide (MXenes)\cite{vahidmohammadi_two-dimensional_2017} were used based on a similar principle where Al$^3^+$ ions intercalated into the MXene layers and vanadium, V$^4^+$ reduced to V$^3{^+}$ during discharge and reversibly oxidised to V$^4^+$ during charge. Metal oxides such as MoO$_3$\cite{lahan_al3+_2019}, chevrel phase Mo$_6$S$_8$ \cite{geng_reversible_2015}, Ni$_3$S$_2$ \cite{wang_novel_2016}, MoS$_2$\cite{li_rechargeable_2018}, TiS$_2$\cite{geng_titanium_2017} and carbon-based materials have been tested as cathodes for AIBs. Materials with high surface area such as three-dimensional hierarchical CuS microspheres\cite{wang_high-performance_2017}, zeolite-template carbon\cite{stadie_zeolite-templated_2017} as an ordered microporous cathode, have shown better battery performance by providing shorter diffusion lengths thus making it easier for ions to intercalate or get absorbed onto the surface of the active material. 
Graphite has been a popular choice for cathodes in AIBs due to its layered structure. Various forms of graphite such as fluorinated graphite\cite{rani_fluorinated_2013}, Kish graphite flakes\cite{wang_kish_2017}, three-dimensional graphitic-foam\cite{lin_ultrafast_2015}, graphene mesh network\cite{chen_ultrafast_2017}, few-layer graphene aerogels\cite{qiao_defect-free_2019} and several other forms, have been tried as cathodes for AIBs, which showed discharge capacities ranging from 60-250 mAh g$^-{^1}$. The AlCl$_4^¯$ anions intercalate into the graphitic stacks and deintercalate during discharge. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy studies have widely been used to establish the mechanism\cite{wang_advanced_2017}. Splitting of the graphite 002 peak 2 $\theta$ = 26.55, into two separate peaks indicated intercalation of AlCl$_4{^¯}$ anions resulting in highly strained graphene stacks.  During discharge, the pristine graphite peak reappears suggesting reversible intercalation /deintercalation of AlCl$_4^¯$ anions. Raman data revealed a doublet peak during charge, indicating vibration of carbon atoms in the interior graphite planes, which finally resulted in one single peak after the cell was fully charged indicating two stages of intercalation. While the cell discharged, pristine graphite spectra reappeared. XPS studies confirmed the reversible oxidation/reduction of carbon when AlCl$_4^¯$ anions intercalate/deintercalate respectively. While AlCl$_4^-$ ions act as the charge-carrying species for a few cathodes, MoS2 guy displayed intercalation of Al$^3{^+}$ ions when the cells discharged. Therefore, it can be said that a single mechanism for AIBs does not exist; it changes with every cathode material and its structure. 


\section{Results and Discussion}

Scheme 1 displays the crystal structure of MoX$_2$ where X = S, Se. The molecule has two vacant sites --- M1 and M2. M1 denotes the spaces in between the X-Mo-X bonds whereas M2, a larger site, is denoted by separation of two layers of MoX$_2$ with an inter-layer distance of 6.3\AA. The layers are held at this distance via van-der-Waals (vdW) forces. The M2 site presents an open network and various interstitial sites, which can easily accommodate the AlCl$_4^{-}$ anion, which are 5.28\AA\ in size as reported by Takahashi {\it et al}. An argument can be made about the kind of ion that participates in the intercalation process during charge. Wang {\it et al.} reported participation of Al$^{3+}$ cations, which not only had to overcome their strong electrostatic effect to get in between the layers, but their participation also reduced the reversibility of the redox process by forming complexes with the sulphide ions that remained in the vacant site during discharge. According to our preliminary tests, we found that the participation of Al$^{3+}$ would rather \lq contract\rq\ the MoX$_2$ layers. Density Functional Theory (DFT) studies carried out by Pathak {\it et al.}, showed that AlCl$_4^-$ anions intercalated within the graphite system with its energetically stable tetrahedral form, which is distorted due to the vdW inter-layer attraction forces between the host graphite layers. Here, we propose the intercalation of AlCl$_4^-$ anions into the M2 sites of MoX$_2$ during charging process. The electrochemical results, cyclic voltammetric scans, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results discussed later strongly support the reversible nature of the intercalation process.

A modified two-electrode polyether ether ketone (PEEK) cell was used to make electrochemical measurements on aluminium-ion batteries (AIBs). Electrode preparations and cell configurations are described in the Methods section. After testing the molybdenum dichalcogenides for AIB cathodes, we found that in general, MoSe$_2$ was superior to MoS$_2$ and MoSSe, with higher and more stable capacities and distinct voltage plateaus. MoSSe was unstable with poor coulombic efficiency of $\sim$50\%. The cathode degraded rapidly after first few cycles and eventually became inactive after a few cycles. It seemed that sulphur substitution weakened the binding energy of Mo-Se allowing the bonds to break easily and thus resulting in rapid cathode degradation and hence, fading capacity. The presence of higher defects in the lattice structure of MoSSe (see XRD and Raman data) compared to MoS$_2$ and MoSe$_2$, contribute to its poor performance as a cathode material in AIBs.

\caption{First charge/discharge curve at 40 mA g$^-^1$ for a) MoS$_2$, b) MoSe$_2$ and c) MoSSe.}
\end{figure}
% Figure 1 here


Figure 1 shows the charge/discharge curves (CDC) for MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$and MoSSe. The average voltage was observed at 1.8 V for MoS$_2$, 1.7 V for MoSe$_2$ and 0.6 V for MoSSe. For MoS$_2$, capacity after the first discharge was 43 mAh g$^{-1}$, which reduced to 40 mAh g$^{-1}$ and 31 mAh g$^{-1}$ in its second and third cycle respectively. We compared the CDC of the first cycle with their first cyclic voltammetry (CV) scan (Fig 1e) and found a good resemblance between the discharging plateaus (1.9 V and 0.7 V) and reduction peak positions, and in between the charging plateau (2.1 V) and oxidation peak positions. The two-step redox processes have good reversibility, seen in Significant Figure (SF) 1. However, the cell recorded an abnormally high charging capacity in its first cycle. Since intercalation of AlCl$_4^-$ takes places during charging, the irreversible capacity can be attributed to the dissociation of Al$_2$Cl$_7^-$ ions at the electrode surface, or formation of an SEI layer may also render a few side reactions that take place on the electrode-electrolyte interface at such high potentials. CDC for MoSe$_2$ revealed interesting results. With discharge plateaus at 1.9 V and 1.7 V, the first CV scan observed a reduction peak at 1.0 V and 1.65 V. The reduction peak at 1.0 V disappeared after the first scan. This peak can be attributed to an irreversible phase transition that takes place in MoSe$_2$ in its first cycle\cite{fan_hybrid_2017}. During this transition, a semi-conducting 2H phase converts to a more metallic 1T phase.  This transition works in favour of the cathode as it increased the interlayer spacing of MoSe$_2$ (by reducing the vdW forces) and allowing more AlCl$_4^-$ ions to intercalate, thus leading to a higher capacity than MoS$_2$. From the CDC and CV scans, it is apparent that the redox processes are reversible in nature as the discharging plateaus continue to appear at 1.8 V and 2.1 V and charging plateau appears at 2.0 V (Fig S5) after 200 cycle at a current rate of 100 mAg$^{-1}$. A similar phenomenon of high charging capacity during the first cycle was observed and can be similarly attributed to above-mentioned reasons. MoSSe cathode, observed three distinct plateaus during charge at 1.7 V, 2.0 V and 2.3 V in its first cycle with a very low discharge plateau at 0.5 V. The first CV scan revealed a distinct reduction potential at 0.9 V, which disappeared after 1st cycle implying a similar irreversible phase transition. We noticed only one reduction peak at 1.7 V in the consecutive scans and its intensity increased with every cycle. This did not seem to be a part of any redox process as no plateau was observed at that potential in its CDC. An increase in charging capacity during the first three cycles might have been due to... The rate capability test for three electrodes was carried out at various current rates of 25, 40 and 100 mA/g. Lower capacities at higher current rates can be attributed to the decrease in the number of ions transferred in between the electrode and the electrolyte, which decreases the battery capacity. An increase in resistance at higher current rates can also be a reason why the capacity fades.

% Figure 2 here

Both MoS$_2$ and MoSe$_2$ have similar interlayer distance (6.5 \AA) but MoSe$_2$ recorded a higher capacity and a more stable cycle life than MoS$_2$. This behaviour can be attributed to the different charge storage mechanisms the two materials follow. CV curves for MoSe$_2$ (Fig 2b) and MoSSe (Fig 2c) have a higher area than MoS$_2$ (Fig 2a) and a more rectangular shape suggesting an additional electrocapacitive mechanism. Charge storage in MoS$_2$ is primarily based on reversible intercalation of AlCl$_4^-$ ions during charge at 1.9 V (Fig S1). MoSe$_2$ showed an intercalation process and an electric double-layer charge storage at the electrode-electrolyte interface, resulting in a higher capacity and a high area under the CV curve. In addition, the phase transition for MoSe$_2$ and MoSSe (2H$\rightarrow$1T) is prominent in their first cycle at 0.9 V. No such transitions were observed for MoS$_2$. CV scan of MoSSe, which lacked any reversible redox peaks, revealed the capacity is mainly focused on non-Faradaic behaviour.

%Figure 3 here....

Figure 3 displays the X-ray diffraction measurements of MoSe$_2$ and MoSSe electrodes cycled at current rate of 40 mA g$^{-1}$. XRD spectra for MoS$_2$ (Fig S6) compares the pristine (verified by JCPDS No. 17-0744) and charged electrode. The 002 plane (along the c-axis of MoS$_2$) shifted from 14.21\degree\  to 14.02\degree. MoSe$_2$ displayed significantly broadened peaks after charge. The diffraction peak at 2$\theta$ values of 13.4\degree\ (002) disappeared after charging, whereas the peaks at  27.28\degree\ (004), 41.64\degree\ (006) and 51.59\degree\ (106) shifted to 25.58\degree\ , 38.08\degree\  and 44.38\degree\ respectively. The 004 and 006 planes are along the c-axis of the molecule and a decrease in their theta values indicates an increase in the interlayer spacings. This confirms the intercalation of planar AlCl$_4^-$ ions. A new diffraction peak was observed at 44.38\degree, which can be attributed to a new intercalation complex formed after intercalation of AlCl$_4^-$. MoSSe, however, does not have a well-defined crystal structure, which is evident from its diffraction pattern (Fig 3b). The defects might have formed during sulphur substitution in the Mo-Se bond making the Mo-Se bond weaker, which is why the cathode starts to degrade after a few cycles. Interestingly, the 004 plane at 26\degree\ disappears after discharge.

To further establish the phase transition effect in MoSe$_2$- X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used, which is a useful tool in distinguishing different polymorphs (2H and 1T) and oxidation states of transition metal dichalcogenides. Detailed narrow spectrum scan (Figure 4) displays the binding energy of Mo (3d5/2 and 3d3/2), S (2p3/2 and 2p1/2), Se (3d5/2 and 3d3/2) and Al 2p peaks for charged MoSe$_2$ and MoSSe electrodes. The binding energies for Mo 3d in pristine in MoSe$_2$ and MoSSe were observed at 229.4 eV and 232.6 eV (Fig S7a) corresponding to Mo$^{4+}$ 3d5/2 and Mo$^{4+}$ 3d3/2 from the 2H polymorph. Any shift in binding energy or peak splitting in an XPS spectrum can be used to detect phase change or a change in oxidation states of an element. Binding energies of sulphur at 163.5 eV and 162.6 eV corresponding to 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 respectively, did not record any peak shift (Fig S8a and b). For pristine MoSe$_2$ electrodes, the binding energy of Mo 3d observed two peaks at 229.1 eV and 232.2 eV corresponding to 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 and Se 3d included a doublet at 55.4 eV and 54.6 eV corresponding to Se 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 respectively (Fig S9a and b). The peak for Mo 3d3/2 split into two peaks at 233.1 eV and 232.6 eV and Mo 3d 5/2 split into 229.4 eV and 229.2 eV (Fig 4a) after the electrodes were charged. Peak for Se 3d3/2 at 55.4 eV split into 56.0 eV and 55.7 eV (Fig S9b). The peak splitting implies presence of higher oxidation states (Mo$^{4+}$ $\rightarrow$ Mo6+) states and transformation of MoSe$_2$ in 2H phase to a more conducting 1T phase. In the pristine electrode of MoSSe, spectra for Mo 3d (Fig S10) and Se 3d deconvoluted into multiple peaks (Mo$^{4+}$ 3d3/2 into 232.2 eV and 231.7 eV and Mo$^{4+}$ 3d5/2 into 229.1 eV and 228.6 eV) indicating presence of both polymorphs, 2H and 1T, with various oxidation states of Mo (+4 and +6) and Se (+2 and +4). For the MoSSe electrode, peak area increased for Mo 3d peak at 231.7 eV and 228.6 eV corresponding to 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 respectively (Fig . Increase in the 1T polymorph after the first cycle increases the peak areas. In addition, the doublet for Se 3d was replaced by one broad peak, which can be deconvoluted into four peaks at 55.9 eV, 55.2 eV, 54.6 eV and 54.0 eV further confirming the presence of a different polymorph. A new peak at ~236 eV in Mo 3d spectra for MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$ and MoSSe electrodes (Fig S7b, Fig 4a and 4b) corresponds to Mo6+ species from MoO3 after exposure of the electrode in air. Fig S10 suggests presence of MoO3 in the pristine MoSSe electrode. XPS probing for Al 2p showed presence of Al in all charged electrodes of MoS$_2$ (Fig S12), MoSe$_2$ (Fig 4c) and MoSSe (Fig 4d). The MoSe$_2$ electrode (Fig 4c) displayed binding energies of Al 2p at 77 eV and 76eV corresponding to chlorides (Al$_x$Cl$_y$) and Al2O3 respectively. The oxide formation can be attributed to the passivation of the anode. As AlCl$_4^-$ ions intercalate into MoSe$_2$ layers, a new peak at 69 eV was detected indicating formation of a new complex. MoSSe electrode displayed broad peaks at 74.5 eV and 76 eV (Fig 4d) indicating large amount of Al2O3 and chloroaluminate ions respectively. High atomic ratio of AlxCly implies electrolyte residue. Thus, due to increase in 1T phase in both MoS$_2$ and MoSe$_2$, it becomes easier for the AlCl$_4^-$ ions to intercalate in between its layers.

\end{figure}
% Figure 6 here

We compared the Raman spectra of pristine and charged electrodes of MoSe$_2$ and MoSSe to detect shift in the vibrational modes of the molecule, which would imply presence of polymorphs. Two peaks corresponding to E12g and A1g vibrational modes for MoS$_2$ (Fig S14) are prominent at 384.6 cm$^{-1}$ and 410.2 cm$^{-1}$ respectively. A1g indicates an out-of-plane symmetric displacement of S atoms, whereas E12g suggests an in-layer displacement. A separation between the two modes indicates a multilayer structure, which is observed for all three materials. No significant peak shift was observed for the charged MoS$_2$ electrode implying no phase change. Raman spectra of MoSe$_2$ (Fig 6a) displayed broadening of A1g peak at 240.6 cm$^{-1}$, which shifted to 239.3 cm$^{-1}$ after intercalation of AlCl$_4^-$ ions. E12g peak at 284.5 cm$^{-1}$ shifted to 279.2 cm indicating an increase in lattice defect sites. These shifts and peak broadening correspond to phase transition of MoSe$_2$ from semiconducting 2H phase to more metallic and conducting 1T phase. This confirms with our previous results where we observed phase transition for MoSe$_2$ but not in MoS$_2$. Fig 6b showed the vibrational modes of MoSSe with A1g peak at 281.2 cm$^{-1}$ and E12g at 336.4 cm$^{-1}$. A1g peak in the pristine MoSSe electrode broadened after intercalation of AlCl$_4^-$ ions but the change was not as significant as MoSe$_2$. Raman results help us further establish the fact that MoSe$_2$ underwent significant structural changes allowing better intercalation of AlCl$_4^-$ ions than MoS$_2$. 

\section{Conclusions}
In summary, MoSe$_2$ exhibited a higher capacity and cyclic stability than MoS$_2$ and MoSSe, as the cathode material for AIBs. The CV and XPS results indicated an irreversible phase transition from 2H to a more metallic 1T phase. We found from our XRD, XPS and Raman results that AlCl$_4^-$ seemed to intercalate reversibly into MoSe$_2$, whereas there was little evidence for intercalation into other molybdenum chalcogenides. This proposed intercalation also resulted in an increased performance of MoSe$_2$-based electrodes compared with the others. The battery had a high average voltage of ∼2.0 V, and it delivers a specific capacity of about 80 mAh g$^−{^1}$ with nearly 95$\%$ coulombic efficiency at a current density of 40 mA g$^{−^1}$. This makes MoSe$_2$ a a promising cathode material for rechargeable AIB applications.


\section{Experimental Section}
\subsection{Cathode preparation}
Slurry was prepared by mixing MoX$_2$ (85$\%$ by wt.), 9$\%$ binder (PVDF, MTI Corporation) and 6$\%$ Super-P conductive carbon (99+$\%$ metals basis, Alfa Aesar) in N-methyl pyrrolidone NMP (anhydrous, 99.5$\%$, Sigma-Aldrich). It was ‘doctor-bladed’ on molybdenum foil (thickness 0.1 mm, MTI Corporation) and dried in a vacuum oven at 120°C for 12 hours to adhere the slurry on the conductive substrate and evaporate the solvent. Specific loading of hBN was 12 mg cm$^-{^2}$. 
\subsection{Electrolyte preparation}
Anhydrous AlCl$_3$ (Sigma-Aldrich) and EMImCl (97$\%$, Sigma-Aldrich) were mixed in a molar ratio of 1.3:1, at room temperature. EMImCl was baked in vacuum for 24 hours at 100°C to remove residual moisture. Small aliquots of AlCl$_3$ was added to EMImCl after every few minutes. The ionic liquid was stirred for 2-3 hours until a clear brown liquid was obtained. Since the electrolyte is hygroscopic in nature, it was prepared in a N$_2$-filled glove box with <0.1 ppm H$_2$O/O$_2$. 
\subsection{Cell assembly}
PEEK (polyether ether ketone) cells were used for electrochemical measurements. Molybdenum rods were used as current collectors. MoX$_2$ coated on molybdenum foil was used as the cathode and placed at bottom of the cell. Two glass microfibers (Grade GF/F, Whatman) were used as separators. 80µl of the electrolyte was used to wet the separator. Aluminium foil (thickness 0.1 mm, 99$\%$, GoodFellow) used as an anode and placed on top of the separator. The cell was then sealed and wrapped with a paraffin film to avoid any air or moisture contact. It was assembled in a N$_2$-filled glove box. Since this was a two-electrode setup, aluminium foil was used as both counter and reference electrode. The cell was taken out of the glove box and electrochemical measurements were performed.
